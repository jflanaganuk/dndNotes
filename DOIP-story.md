# Prelude

The sky is dark, and the air is still. 
A fortress stands proud on the side of a mountain, hugging the side as if holding on for dear life, but the structure is sound, secure, it has stood here for eons and won't falter today. 
Inside, Ugor, the Orc blacksmith smashes down his hammer to forge a new blade. No doubt that this honed edge will slay many an enemy in it's day. Randigar and Serlink - both larger Orcs than Ugor - are keeping watch on the crenellations outside of the castle. Today is no different from any other day and Randigar and Serlink are both being complacent in their duties, very few souls even know of this place's existence, let alone will plan to attack it.

Ugor smashes his hammer down again with a thud, its resonant chime echoing through the chilled halls of the fortress. Randigar cracks a joke and Serlink laughs, a wolf's howl is heard in the distance.

Ugor raises his masterpiece infront of his beady eyes and examines his fine work, he is proud of the edge he has created and it should serve his Orc master well in combat. He dips it into a vat of water with a sharp hissing sound to quench the blade.

Serlink has said something to Randigar that he doesn't like and they start to fall out, they turn away from each other for a little while. As they have nothing better to do, they quickly reconsile and are back to poking fun at each other again.

The air outside begins to howl, it is not unusual for the wind to pick up from time to time up in the mountains, and doesn't cause any concern to inhabitant Orcs. With a sharp blow, the wind howls through into Ugor's room and blows out a few of his candles. He grunts and gets up reluctantly, he carefully relights his candles allowing him to see the room clearly again.

Ugor turns sharply.

He heard something...

Something big.

What sounded like a huge beast roaring in the distance, and almost what sounds like, flapping perhaps?

Randigar heard it too and tells Serlink to be quiet with a sharp hit to his chest. He freezes and points to the sky. Serlink tries to follow his stubby green finger to see where he is pointing, he sees what Randigar sees - heading straight towards them - and his eyes narrow...

## Session 01 - 27/02/2020
### Chapter 1
##### Harbin

The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly aligned with the neighboring Dwarves and Gnomes. Then an Orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.
 
In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.

The heroes are currently sat in the town green, reminiscing about their adventurers of past. Marlade, the Human Cleric is currently telling them all how great the god Savras is, but the other two do not seem interested at all. An Elf Bard, Sasha, is currently tuning her prized lute that she inherited from her noble family. The last member of this party, a hulking Goliath Barbarian named Minogar Threefury towers over them both, laughing at Marlade's futile attempts at conversion.

Harbin Wester, a sorry looking, podgy man is making his way as fast as his feeble body would allow him to shuffle towards the heroes. As he arrives, out of breath, he makes a shrewd comment about how they are "supposedly" adventurers and mentions how he only knows about them thanks to his townsfolk letting him know they are in the area.

He does have a quest to offer the group, however, and offers it forcefully, being too excitable to even wait for a response.

"Ah you must be the would-be adventurers I keep hearing the people gossip about, but I have need your help with an issue, and it must be kept hush-hush as it were" he exclaims with his posh dialect and an inflection of superiority.

"Well, you see, its the farmer's son, he has gone missing" he says with a slight frown which could be mistaken for genuine concern, but is really for his own image than that of the well being of the boy.

He mutters something to himself, forgetting that he is within earshot "Ever since that night when they came...". He realises quickly that he is not alone, "Oh, sorry! Where was I, ignore that, ahem!"

"Hes gone missing, yes, and I need you to search for the poor boy, he must<br/>
be so scared, out<br/>
there on his own,<br/>
poor thing, poor<br/>
thing. I would ask<br/>
around the town<br/>
if I were you,<br/>
surely<br/>
someone<br/>
knows<br/>
something about<br/>
where he would have<br/>
got too. I would do it<br/>
myself of course, but<br/>
you know, the old<br/>
gammy leg playing up<br/>
again HAHA, the old<br/>
leg you see"

  style='position:absolute; bottom:50px; right:30px; width:380px' />

Harbin lifts up the bottom of his leg to show the party, it is grim. Sasha recoils slightly and wishes she hadn't looked.

Excitedly, he says "Thanks again, for doing this, just remember I will be in my house if you need me, do let me know when you have found him"

He pauses for a second and says "There will of course be, a reward" gesturing with his hands to indicate financial reward, but doesn't say how much.

Harbin retreats back to the Townmaster's hall as quickly as he came out, onto the next important task he has to do that day.


The group are left a little bewildered by that encounter, but decide to carry out his wishes and ask around town, they head over to the Stonehill Inn first.

> ##### Stonehill Inn
> The Stonehill Inn is the main Inn in Phandalin (but not the only one) it is a family ran business consisting of the Father, Toblen Stonehill, his wife Trilena, and their son Pip.
>
> Often, only the Parents are the ones running the Inn, as Pip is too young to be of much help, he is often found playing in the streets of Phandalin with his best friend Carp.

### Chapter 2
##### Lanar

Inside the Inn, the heroes are greeted with a warm atmosphere and a cosy decor. There is a man sitting alone nursing a pint and two men further into the Inn engaged in conversation, one of them looking like a knight.

Behind the bar are the two owners of the establishment, Toblen and his wife Trilena, looking at the heroes who have just entered.

Marlade immediately goes to sit with the drunk looking man, possibly due to his clerical nature in wanting to help the sick and down trodden. The other two head over to the bar and speak to Toblen.

Minogar walks up to the bar, hunching his back slightly to fit under the comparitively low ceiling, he begins talking to the barkeep - Toblen. He orders 5 ales and pays with a single gold piece. This slightly irks Toblen as he has to go the register and get lots of change out to give back to the goliath.

Sasha asks about the missing boy, Toblen and his wife mention that they didn't even realise the boy was missing.

The heroes tell the couple that the missing boy is the farmer's son but do not know his name.

"Ah, the farmer's boy is named Carp, he plays with our son Pip a lot. To be honest I haven't actually seen him for a couple of days, I never twigged that he had gone missing!" Trilena continues, "You should talk to our son Pip, he is out on the Town Green last I checked!"

The pair take their drinks and turn to sit with the knight and the farmer.

Meanwhile, Marlade is trying to talk to the drunk, but is not making much progress. The drunk is slurring his words and rocking back and forth. "A boy?", the drunk exclaims, "Missing in where you say?"

Marlade groans and continues his endeavour.

Sasha and Minogar have not been noticed by the Knight and Farmer who are talking between themselves, and so they interupt the Knight who is currently talking. He tries to ignore them initially and carry on his conversation, but the pair are persistent and he turns to them, "Do you mind? We are trying to have a conversation here, can you not find somewhere else to sit?".

They ask the knight who he is and what gives him the right to speak to them like that.

"I am a knight of Neverwinter", he says churlishly, "On official business by Lord Dagult Neverember, I am not about to disclose it to peasants such as yourselves. Now if you will excuse me."

He turns back to the farmer and continues his conversation. The adventurers try to instead appeal to the farmer and persuade him to begin a dialog. They ask him about the missing farmer's boy.

"Carp has gone missing?", he asks with a panic, "How long has he been gone?". The pair tell him two days, "Two days?! Wait. Are you sure? He can't have been missing that long. I saw him on the farm yesterday... I was helping him tend to the fields."

They tell him that they are sure he is missing, but he cannot aid them with any information other than what they already know. So they go and sit back with Marlade.

Marlade's patience had grown very thin with the drunken man by this point, however, and he grabs him by the scruf of his neck and leads him out of the Inn. The group follow in a hurry.

A seemingly possessed Marlade, looks around frantically on the doorstep of the inn. He asks the group if they know of any body of water nearby, but they do not. In the center of the town he notices a shrine with a lady kneeling infront of it.

Dragging the reluctant drunk over to the shrine, he notices something odd about the shrine.

  style='position:absolute; bottom:50px; left:30px; width:280px' />
  
> ##### Shrine of Luck
> In the centre of Phandalin is a small outdoor shrine in the shape of a female with her eyes closed. It is dedicated to the goddess Tymora - the goddess of luck - the shrine was built by an inhabitant of the town in order to make it easier to worship.

Angrily, Marlade quickly changes course when he realises the prayer bowl that the elf lady was using is not big enough for what he wants.

Confused, the other two follow him as he drags the poor drunk in the direction of Phandalin's farm.

At the farm, still possessed and quick tempered, Marlade comes up to a water trough - intended for the horses - and throws the drunk down.

Mercilessly, the cleric grabs the back of the drunkards scalp and forces him down into the water, the drunk begins to drown. Nearing his last breath, Marlade lifts his head back out of the water and asks him his name.

Due to this treacherous scenario the drunk finds himself in, he quickly sobers up. "Lanar!! My name is Lanar!!" he exclaims.

Again, the cleric dunks the hapless man, and the other two look on at this spectacle.

Marlade asks him repeatadly where the boy is hidden. Lanar begs the cleric "I do not know, I do not know".

But Marlade isn't satisfied, he knows that Lanar knows something... And will not stop until he knows it too.

This tortuous exercise continues for what seems like an eternity to Lanar, and eventually, he relents. "The boy! The boy! They have taken him into the cave! Please thats all i know!". Marlade asks him who has taken to the cave, "They will kill me if I tell you, I can't".

Back under the water Lanar goes, as Marlade shoves his head down once again. Upon surfacing Lanar trembles, 
<span style="margin-left: 110px">"Please! Please! Im telling you thats</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">all I know, these cultists in black robes</span>
<span style="margin-left: 130px">took him from the farm! They went</span>
<span style="margin-left: 120px">into a cave, but I was too scared to</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">follow! Please! I am but a coward!"</span>

<span style="margin-left: 90px">Marlade stops, feeling pity and a little</span>
<span style="margin-left: 200px">disgust for the poor</span>
<span style="margin-left: 210px">man. The group</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">decide to keep</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">Lanar with them</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">and head to the</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">cave, Lanar is</span>
<span style="margin-left: 240px">forced to lead</span>
<span style="margin-left: 250px">the way.</span>
```
```
### Chapter 3
##### Goblins

Lanar leads the group to the base of the woods south of the ruins of Tresendar Manor.
> ##### Tresendar Manor
> More of a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, and is completely open to the elements nowadays.

As they approach the woods, they see a campfire, reduced to embers. Huddled around this campfire, laughing and snickering, are three Goblins. They are far enough away not to have noticed the adventures, who ready their weapons for combat.

Sasha contemplates what to do for a second and decides to rush in and attack the nearest Goblin with all the might she could muster.

Unfortunately, being a humble bard her attack glances on the Goblin's armor causing no damage and angering it and his accomplices.

Seeing this, Minogar launches a javelin towards the Goblins but it lands short. Meanwhile, Marlade decides to start concentrating on a spell to buff his allies.

The Goblins immediately start wailing on the poor Bard, knocking her unconscious in seconds and one turns his attention to Minogar.

Sasha begins to fade away into the abyss, and Minogar rushes in - his blood boiling. Taking his mighty greataxe in both hands he brings it down hard on the nearest goblin, who is cleft in twain.

Marlade fires his crossbow from distance, and launches an arrow like a bullet straight into the eye of another Goblin, killing it instantly.

Sensing her time is short, Minogar drags Sasha back to the group and Marlade plants his shield in the dirt between her and the remaining Goblin. 

Lanar rushes in seeing Sasha's condition to stabalise her.

Sasha is still unconscious, but thanks to the other two's tremendous bravery, it looks like she might make it.

The remaining Goblin ponders for a second and sees his accomplices dead on the forest floor, he decides to turn tail and run away.

Still raging, Minogar charges through the forest javelin in hand and blood in his eyes for the fleeing Goblin. The Goblin manages to run about 10 feet before it lands right through his vital organs and pins him to the ground. The Goblin writhes for a few seconds, then becomes motionless.

Marlade is tending to Sasha's wounds with his medical kit and manages to just about stabilise her. She gets up slowly, still gravely wounded, but it looks like she has made it and is still alive. For now...

The group turn their attention towards the woods, how will they be press on now?

## Session 02 - 05/03/2020
### Chapter 4
##### Cave

The group decide to head towards the cave, but first they check the bodies of the goblins. One of the goblins has a pouch of gold, which the name "Jayon" written on it, presumably stolen. Another has a letter which reads:

<div class='descriptive'>
Giplin,
 
Take Jogtigs and Pymat and position yourself at the southern most point of Tresendar Woods, do not allow any intruders past this point, lest they find the entrance to our hideout.
 
I do not need to tell you that our operations would be in jeopardy if we were to be found out.
 
Once again, if you let me down once more, the punishment is death... So don't!
 
Iarno
</div>

Pondering the note, the group pause and look around for more threats, before realising that the letter is addressed to the goblins that they had killed.

Lanar leads the group through the woods north and they arrive at the mouth of the cave, Lanar complains that without a weapon he is defenseless. The group don't really want to arm their captive, but give him one of the goblin's schimitars to shut him up, the group light torches and peer inside.

A cold breeze fills the large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty foot high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm. There appears to be bones of some description to the east of the chasm, between the two bridges.

The group listen and can hear the faint sounds of torture and various magical effects.

Minogar bravely heads down a corridor to his left on his own, at the end of the corridor he sees two doors, one to his left leading south and one to his right to the north. He decides to listen at the southern door, but cannot hear anything on the other side.

He then walks over to the northern door, and listens again, inside this room he hears people shouting and what sounds like the same people playing a game involving dice - it sounds like they are merry and one of them has just lost a lot of money.

The rest of the group decide to head a bit further north back in the cave and head down another corridor, also heading left. This corridor also has two doors at the end of it, both pointing north and south. They use Sasha to send messages between themselves and deduce that the southern door for them may link to the door that Minogar is listening too.

The group listen to their door, the one pointing south, and also hear the game being played that Minogar could hear, but louder.
```
```
They decide that they should do a pincer movement and both sides prepare to burst through their respective doors with intent to kill whoever is inside.

Minogar bursts into the room and sees<br>
several worn tables and chairs scattered around<br>
this large room. Wooden benches are drawn<br>
up against walls decorated with<br>
draperies of brown and red, and<br>
several ale kegs are propped up and<br>
tapped. Four human figures wearing<br>
robes of purple and black are gathered<br>
around one of the tables. A stack of<br>
coins and trinkets is heaped upon the<br>
tabletop between them.

He throws a javelin at the<br>
closest figure and hits him in the<br>
neck, the human proceeds to bleed<br>
to death, Minogar also takes his axe<br>
and slices the head off another in<br>
a brutal display of barbaric rage.<br>
The unfortunate human's head<br>
rolls over to the other two cultists,<br>
who appear to be drunk and don't<br>
quite realise what is happening<br>
yet.

The rest of the group burst<br>
into the room and Marlade<br>
puts his crossbow point<br>
blank to back of the head<br>
of one of the remaining two cultists. He<br>
fires but it jams, and he instead whacks the human in the head with the butt of his crossbow.

Lanar lifts his schimitar high above his head and attempts to attack the remaining cultist, but can barely swing it and misses.

Sasha stabs the one that Marlade hit earlier with her longsword and kills him, she then throws a dagger at the other one and hits him right between the eyes, killing him instantly.

The group collect themselves and search the bodies, they hold nothing of value but the game they were playing sure does. It looks like the cultists were playing a game involving betting and there is a lot of money on the table, which the group take.

### Chapter 5
##### Consequences

After their resounding victory the group are feeling fearless and confident, they head to the door Minogar found to the south, and Sasha listens to it.

She recoils slightly and says she can hear a language being spoken that she cannot understand, and it sounds demonic.

Knowing Abyssal, Marlade puts his ear to the door and hears the following conversation between three people, which he translates to the group:

<div class='descriptive'>
Person 1: "Why did he capture that boy, he is going to expose the lot of us?"<br>
Person 2: "Silence, Ionar knows what he is doing, he obviously has plans for that retched scoundrel"<br>
Person 3: "Yeah, hopefully use him to clean up around here, this place is a mess, or at least sacrafice the insulent whelp, get some use out of him"<br>
Person 1: "But how can you trust Ionar when he couldn't even keep his old master alive?"<br>
Person 2: "Nezznar was weak and short sighted, we are much better serving under (unintelliagable demonic words), he will bring the dawn of a new age!"<br>
Person 1: "I hope you are right, for all our sakes..."
</div>

Marlade then kicks the door down, miraculously the inhabitants do not notice, he sees a barracks that contains four roughly built wooden bunks. In the centre of the room is a pile of skulls surrounded by dimly lit candles. Four humanoids in hooded cloaks are stood equal distance around the skulls, murmurring under their breath.

Marlade attacks the nearest one, and shoots a bolt at the back of his head, the cultists barely flinches as blood trickles down the back of his neck from the arrow, the cultist slowly turns around and Marlade sees his face, the stench of death fills the room and his horrifying visage is burned into Marlade's mind forever. The cultist's appearance is that of a corpse, his eyes milky white and his jaw dropped slightly on his dark grey wrinkled face, the purple magic eminating from the skull in the centre of the room spirals around the four cultists and almost appears to be propping them up.

The cultist lets out a demonic shout and fires purple lightning from his fingers, hitting Marlade. Marlade is raised up into the air and cannot move an inch.

Sasha then tries to come to Marlade's aid and throws a dagger at the cultist, hitting it in the eye and sticking there. The cultist just tips his head to the side and throws the same purple lightning at Sasha, she takes her longsword and deflects the blast but is knocked backwards.

Another cultists turns towards the elf and also casts the purple lightning, unfortunately, Sasha is not quick enough to deflect again and is suspended in the air, suffering the same fate as Marlade.

Minogar goes into the room and attacks, Lanar sees his oppurtunity and says "I told you they would kill me!" and runs back into the cave, abandoning the party.

The barbarian takes his axe and slams it into the cultist's torso with all his might, it gets lodged into it's torso and the cultist screams demonic noises and launches Minogar into the air with purple lightning. The whole party is now suspended in the air, paralyzed.

The cultist slowly removes all the weapons embedded into his body and throws them to the ground, he begins to speak common - laughing at the party. He hovers over to Marlade, "Your gods can't save you now, cleric!", his speech is gutterall and deep, otherworldly. With a thud he knocks out Marlade and releases him from the spell, the cleric lands in a heap on the floor, out cold.

The demonic cultist then turns to Sasha, "Aren't you a bit far from home, little elf?", and knocks her out same as Marlade. Finally he turns to Minogar, "Big and strong Goliath, where did that get you?", and knocks him out all the same.

All the group can see is blackness, the eternal void. They can hear something though...

They hear gnashing, scraping, the clanging of weapons and demonic screams, they hear sounds of slaughter but also the unmistakeable sound of dragon fire.

Marlade is awoken, not by his own accord but by the figure currently looming over him. As his vision focuses, he sees a Red Dragonborn clad in plate armor kneeling over him, "Are you OK friend?" the Dragonborn asks, his voice harsh but kind.

Marlade sits up and the Dragonborn goes over to Sasha, he places his hand on her chest and Marlade swears he can see his hand glow when he does this, Sasha slowly sits up, dazed and confused.

Finally, the Dragonborn goes to<br>
Minogar and helps him up, the group<br>
stand up and dust themselves down.<br>
They are still in the same room as the<br>
cultists, but it looks like they met their<br>
end, they are in pieces scattered<br>
around the room. The glowing skull<br>
from earlier is now faintly<br>
humming pink and there<br>
appears to be no more<br> magic in the air.

### Chapter 6
##### Urzal

The Dragonborn speaks to the party, "Hello, my name is Urzal, Urzal Desecrate - I am a Paladin of the Lord's Alliance. I have been following you since you left Phandalin, you see I have been tasked with finding the leader of these cultists - the Zhentarim - and bringing him to justice for his crimes in Neverwinter. My findings lead me to this hideout and I saw you taking on those Goblins earlier. I must say I was impressed how you handled them, especially you Goliath! It is a good job I was following you, you didn't stand a chance against these four, they were casting a Ritual of Undeath and were effectively immortal. I would advise you to exercise a little more caution when travelling around hideouts or dungeons you aren't familiar with!"

Urzal lets out a hearty laugh, the group decide to stick together with the Paladin, and head north past the other cultists they killed earlier and listen to the northen most door. Urzal hears bubbling coming from the room and is confused but says he feels like he can almost hear the sound of a small boy sobbing. The group exclaim that they are searching for a small boy, and Marlade goes to kick the door in.

Urzal rages and stops Marlade from lurching forward, "What are you doing?! We need to  be more stealthy in this place if we are to be successful! Tyr's sake, how did you get this far in this dungeon doing that?!". The Dragonborn turns back to the door and advises the group open it slowly and peer in, as they can't possibly know what is inside.

Sasha slowly pokes her head in, she sees a room that appears to be a wizard's workshop. There is a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes. In the corner of the room is a small cage, with a boy stuffed into it, barely fitting, he is looking down and hasn't noticed the party.

> ##### Urzal the barbarian - or is it paladin now?
> Urzal was a member of an adventuring party who five years ago set out to find the Lost Mine of Phandelver and recover the Forge of Spells before an evil drow mage named Nezznar could take it for himself.
> 
> Back then, he was a Barbarian and often consumed by rage, it appears that since then he has found strength in the light and has taken an oath to become a paladin, although he still carries his trusty two-handed axe named Carn, perhaps his old Barbaric tendencies haven't completely left him after all?

Marlade looks around the alchemy table and pockets some items he think may be of use in the future, Sasha goes over to the boy in the cage, but he is unresponsive with his head down.

She tries to open the cage but as soon as her hand touches the cage, it passes through as though it isn't there, she realises the cage is sealed with a spell, they will have to find the mage that cast it.

The group see a door to another room next to the cage, they start to listen to it, Marlade decides to back track through the dungeon and try and create a pincer situation again.

Minogar listens to the door and can hear two voices, but cannot totally make out what is being said, one is completely foreign to him, but one seems to sound like Lanar...

### Chapter 7
##### Found

As Marlade heads back into the original cave entrance he tries to cross a chasm in the cave using a rickety bridge, it feels very unstable as he crosses but he makes it to the other side, he then heads north into a store room.

This area is the north end of the large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails. 

Marlade takes some of the hammers for later and inspects the room, as it appears to be a dead end.

To his left however, he sees light peering through the wall in the shape of a door, it is a secret door made of stone!

The rest of the group are still listening to the other door, and decide to turn the handle to see if it is unlocked. The door is unlocked, but Sasha turning the handle alerts the occupants inside! "Who goes there?" one of them shouts.

With little options left, the group decide to just burst in and try to surprise the occupants. Inside they see a bedchamber walls of which are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed. Standing to their left is a short, dark-bearded human male in robes, he wears a princely mantle of ermine. A beautiful glass staff is in his hands and he is speaking to none other than Lanar.

Lanar's eyes narrow and thinks fast<br>
"Please save me heroes, this mage<br>
has me captive!".

Marlade meanwhile, tries to<br>
open the door he found, but is<br>
struggling to find the<br>
strength.

Urzal attacks the mage<br>
first, but the mage swiftly<br>
moves out of the way of<br>
his greataxe, the mage<br>
casts a spell on himself<br>
using a staff and he begins<br>
to glow with a blue aura,<br>
almost like armour. The<br>
mage then retaliates by<br>
casting purple magic missiles at<br>
Urzal, but they deflect off his<br>
armour.

Minogar then rages and follows up behind Urzal attacking the mage, he lands a decisive hit and the mage reels backwards.

Suddenly, Lanar gets enraged by this and starts to change...

His skin turns dark blue and his eyes become a solid orange, he begins to growl uncontrollably and attacks Minogar with claws. Minogar is able to endure the first swipe thanks to his rock hard endurance afforded to him from his Goliath ancestry, and moves out of the way of the second swipe.

Marlade is still struggling with the stone door, he curses as he can hear his friends engaged in combat inside.

### Chapter 8
##### Iarno

Urzal slashes at the monstrosity that was once Lanar and shouts "Doppelganger!!" as his axe slashes in the direction of the doppelganger, it lurches backwards and avoids the hit.

Minogar aids Urzal and lands a hit on the doppelganger, it lets out a scream and grabs Minogar and begins brutally slashing with it's claws.

With a thud, Minogar falls to the ground gravely wounded, and unconscious from blood loss. Urzal kneels down, Sasha sees his hand begin to glow as he places it on Minogar's chest. With renewed vigor, Minogar rises again.

Sasha tries to keep the mage busy while this is happening and attacks with her shortsword, mortally wounding him, the mage drops to his knees.

Minogar then swings his axe at the doppelganger once again, slicing his left arm clean off. Sasha follows up and stabs at it's other arm with her dagger, sticking it in it's bicep.

Marlade meanwhile, gets angry at not being able to budge the door and cries out for power from his chosen deity - Savras. Suddenly, he is granted immense strength and shatters the stone door to pieces, he expects to see group but 
<span style="margin-left: 160px">instead sees another stone</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">wall.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 160px">To his right leading down a</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">staircase, he sees another</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">stone door, he curses and</span>
<span style="margin-left: 170px">begins to open that one same</span>
<span style="margin-left: 175px">as before.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 175px">The doppelganger is now</span>
<span style="margin-left: 175px">foaming at the mouth and</span>
<span style="margin-left: 180px">lashes out at Minogar with</span>
<span style="margin-left: 185px"> his lone arm, his claws dig</span>
<span style="margin-left: 190px"> into the Goliath's flesh</span>
<span style="margin-left: 195px"> and Minogar lets out a </span>
<span style="margin-left: 200px">roar. Urzal places his</span>
<span style="margin-left: 210px"> hand on Minogar's</span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> shoulder and heals </span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> the damage, he nods</span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> at Minogar.</span>
```
```
Minogar nods back, and lifts his axe swiftly from the ground, striking the doppelganger, who staggers backwards. The doppelganger taunts the group using Lanar's voice "You wouldn't hurt poor Lanar, now would you? Think of all the fun we had!"

The barbarian roars loudly and brings the axe back down, severing the head from the body of the doppelganger, it's head rolls along the floor and the body remains still for a second, before slumping into a heap. The head says it's final words and mouths obscenities towards Minogar.

Marlade manages to open the second stone door, this one is much easier than the first, he bursts in and shoots the kneeling mage in the back. "Gah, I submit! I submit! Please don't kill me!" The mage shouts.

Marlade tells the mage to start talking and to say who he is.

"My names, Iarno, Iarno Glasstaff - I will tell you anything, please. As long you spare me, I will tell you, please!"

## Session 03 - 03/04/2020
### Chapter 9
##### Interrogation

The group begin to interogate the mage, Minogar says to start talking.

"What do you want to know?!", Iarno pleads.

Minogar asks the mage who he is working for.

"They call themselves the 'Zhentarim' they wanted a base of operations in Phandalin, so I obliged."

Minogar asks who the Zhentarim are.

"I do not truly know!", Iarno exclaims "They threatened me if I did not cooperate!"

Minogar asks where the Zhentarim are now. Iarno looks confused and says they are in this very hideout, "How have you not come across any before now?!"

Minogar asks if those cultists they met earlier with the skull are Zhentarim.

"They are the Zhentarim 'Undying', they use young boys to keep themselves alive using their lifeforce, if all you saw was a skull, they must have been using that poor soul for a while now..."

Minogar then grows tired of these questions and hits the mage in the face with his pommel. Urzal growls at Minogar and says they should keep him alive for questioning. The goliath moans about having to keep the mage alive and gets the mage to remove his robes. Iarno complies and drops his staff and robes to the floor and stands there in his boxers, shivering. Sasha plays her flute mockingly while the mage undresses.

Marlade shows no remorse and takes the glasstaff and robes for himself.

Minogar asks the mage if there are any Zhentarim left in the hideout. Iarno grows visibly annoyed and says "How can I possibly know that?!". He pauses for a moment and asks, "Well how many have you lot killed so far?".

Marlade ignores the mage's question and changes the subject, he asks if the doppelganger that was Lanar was created by the mage.

"No, he was given to me as an aide to do my bidding... I guess he won't be doing that anymore..."
\page

  style='position:absolute; top:50px; right:0px; width:280px' />
  
Marlade asks the mage why he is here, and why he would need the aid of the Zhentarim.

"Many years ago, I used to work for another. His name was Nezznar and he had great plans for this land. He set out to hunt for "the forge of spells" a long forgotten enchanted forge that could empower any weapon. Before he could find it however, a band of adventurers destroyed him, mercilessly... I seek to avenge him and bring him back from the eternal void...". The mage turns to the dragonborn and says, "I'm sure you know this story well... Urzal."

Urzal lowers his head and looks back up at the group, he explains that he was a part of that adventuring group and killed Nezznar, he explains that if Nezznar were to be resurrected, it would not be a good thing for the town.

Marlade turns to Urzal and asks what he plans to do with the mage.

"I will take him back to Neverwinter, to the Hall of Justice to stand before Lord Dagult Neverember for his crimes."

Sasha reminds the group about the boy, and asks the mage if he knows how to release him from the cage. Iarno explains that he is the one who locked the cage, and only he knows the incantation to release the boy.

Minogar notices a chest at the base of the bed in the room they are in, he goes over to it and opens it. Inside, he finds a load of gold and silver, aswell as silk pouch which contains jewels and a lustrious pearl. He investigates the chest further, and sees two parchments at the bottom. He takes them out and looks over them. Both are marked with a green wax seal that says "Property of Neverwinter", one is a scroll of charm person, the other is a scroll of fireball.

He tries to quickly pocket them, but Urzal asks what he has found. Minogar decides to be honest about what he has found, and shows them to the dragonborn. He does try to show it from far away to avoid the dragonborn seeing the mark, but Urzal asks to see them closer.

"Is that the mark of Lord Dagult?!" the dragonborn says, "Ordinarily I would take these back to Neverwinter, but I feel you may need these with time. I will allow you to keep them."

Minogar asks if this means they are stolen, and Urzal replies saying that they must be if this grubby mage managed to get his hands on them.

### Chapter 10
##### Rescue

Sasha, Minogar and Urzal decide to take Iarno forcefully back into the previous room and free the boy.

Minogar keeps Iarno restrained and Sasha gets Iarno to free the boy from his prison.

"If I free the boy, then I am of no use to you, how do I know you won't just kill me when my use to you has expired?"

Urzal says that his fate will only be decided by Lord Neverember, and he swears they will not harm the mage as long as he is cooperative.

Minogar also says to the mage that he has little options, and to just get on with it. Sasha threatens the mage with her sword, and Iarno goes up to the cage. He touches the cage and it falls away into nothingness. The boy in the cage, still unresponsive falls backwards onto the cold floor.

Sasha runs over and checks the boy. She deduces that he is alive, but not responding to any external stimuli. Urzal says that he believes it is important to get this boy to safety as quick as possible.

Minogar asks Urzal to try to heal the boy, Urzal goes up to the boy and places his scaly hand on his chest, but quickly withdraws it back. "This seems to be more than just a simple spell..." Urzal says, he looks extremely concerned.

The goliath turns to Iarno and demands to know what is wrong with the boy. "I, I don't know! The Zhentarim cast the spell on him, I only locked him away! I swear!"

Minogar asks the mage if the Zhentarim are doing to the boy what they were doing to the skull in the other room. "I don't believe so," Iarno explains "So far, I have only observed them practicing undeath magic on those recently deceased, as this boy is alive, they can't be as far as I know!"

Urzal now restrains Iarno as Minogar carries the boy, the group rush out of the dungeon as fast as they can.

### Chapter 11
##### Outside

Meanwhile, Mirazumin, an Elf Ranger is being accompanied by one of the town's guards, Marcus. They have also been asked by the Townmaster - Harbin Wester - to search for the missing boy. Their search has also lead them to the cave entrance, just as the other group come rushing outside.

Minogar sees them approaching and asks what they are doing here, he asks if they are with the enemy. Mira says that he is not associated with this mage at all, and explains that the townmaster asked them to come. Mira turns to the dragonborn and speaks his name, recognising him.

Urzal puts down the mage and laughs, "Mira! Long time no see!". Minogar turns to Urzal and asks if he knows this elf, "Yes, very well!" Urzal says "He helped us to defeat Nezznar back in the day!".

"I knew I recognised you, pitiful elf," Iarno fumes.

Mira says to Urzal that he always used to try and kill his pet, and still hasn't forgiven him for that one.

\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
  
Urzal approaches Mira's panther - Misty - and pats it's head, giving Mira a wink, "Ah, it was all in good fun" and chuckles to himself.

Minogar notices that during this exchange, another figure has been approaching the group - from a distance it looks like it is in fully clad armour.

The goliath shouts out to the figure to identify itself, and as the figure walks closer they see that it is indeed a knight, and is none other than Justice Keenseeker, the knight they met in the inn earlier.

"Hail heroes, it is I, Justice Keenseeker, I see you have found the missing boy!" Justice laughs, "Urzal, I knew I could count on you!"

"Thank you sir," Urzal bows whilst Minogar sighs and rolls his eyes.

Sasha complains to the knight that she feels the group are missing out on a little credit here.

"Of course, where are my manners!" as Justice hands a note to Minogar, who proceeds to read it in a silly voice and annoys Justice. Minogar says it is revenge for him not letting him finish his pint.

<div class='descriptive'>
Lord Dagult,
 
I believe I may have solved your "Thundertree" issue.
 
These adventurers have displayed great bravery in the town of Phandalin and I have sent them to your city for you to meet them for yourselves.
 
Signed, Sir Justice Keenseeker
</div>

"It is a knight's commendation," Justice continues "If you ever find yourselves visiting the great city of Neverwinter, show this to one of the guards and they will take you straight to Lord Dagult, as you have shown great bravery on this day, I believe you are the ones who can help him..."

Sasha pipes up after inspecting the boys condition and warns the group that he still needs to be seen to.

Urzal and Justice advise the group to take the boy back into town to his mother, they proceed to take Iarno away and head back to Neverwinter.

Marlade goes up to the boy and tries to see what magic has affected the boy, he believes the boy has been cursed in some way and that a potion of healing may help.

Sadly, the group do not possess a single one.

Sasha turns to Marcus and asks who he is.

He looks annoyed and says he is the person here to do a job that the group do not seem to have done properly, he also scolds the group for the way they spoke to the knight earlier. He is at least impressed that the boy is still alive at least.

Marlade again tries to heal the boy, but it appears to make his condition worse, Marcus shouts at Marlade saying the machinations of his spell are not doing the boy any good.

Minogar comes in and asks what does Marcus suggest them to do, and Marcus shrugs but says that they need to act quickly, whatever they decide to do. Minogar goes over and picks up the boy, as Sasha is growing weary and the group head back into Phandalin in the direction of the farm.
```
```
### Chapter 12
##### Qelline

The group arrive back at Alderleaf farm and see the familiar cottage with its red roof, smoke slowly seeping out the chimney. However, the curtains are all drawn and when they try the door they discover it is locked.

Minogar knocks loudly on the wooden frame, shouting that they have the boy and to let them in.

"I don't believe you, go away", a small raspy old ladylike voice cries out from inside. "I've lost my boy, let me grieve in peace."

Sasha goes up to the door and tries to persuade the old woman to let them inside, her kind words resonate with the old woman and she decides to open the door slowly.

As the door opens, Sasha sees nothing before her, confused, she then looks down and sees a small halfling woman standing there with tears down her face. Sasha turns to allow the woman to see Minogar carrying the boy and explains that while they have saved the boy, he is still very unwell.

The group ask who she is, "I am Qelline, Qelline Alderleaf, I am this boy's mother and I run the Alderleaf farm!"

The little woman is initially excited to see her boy once more, but quickly returns to being solemn once realising the state he is in. Sasha asks if the woman has any potions of healing that they could try, and she leaps into action and starts looking around her house for any potions.

She comes back to the group with her head hanging, saying she thought she had some, but alas has none left. "I know!" she shouts, "You could visit Barthen in town, he normally sells potions and what-not!"

The group decide to leave the boy with his mother and head over to Barthen's Provisions.

### Chapter 13
##### Barthens

Arriving outside they see a rather large building, Barthen's is the biggest tradepost in Phandalin . It's shelfs stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown.

With door being left ajar, the group head inside and see a bald man with a small white beard behind the counter, it is Elmar Barthen, the shopkeeper, he greets them with a hearty hello.

He recognises Marcus and asks how the town guard is doing. Marcus says things could be better but still good, he tells Elmar. He also lets Elmar know they have found the missing boy, but that he appears to be cursed.
  
Minogar asks Elmar to help the group, "I don't how I could be of help im afraid, I know very little about curses," Elmar explains.

Sasha says he can help by selling them a potion of healing, "Ah, yes... well normally I would... but you see... my shipment hasn't arrived. And to be honest, it hasn't arrived for a while now. Normally I get a shipment say, once a week from an old lady who brews them just south of the town at Umbrage hill. But no-one has heard from her for weeks."

The group seem bewildered that an old woman has not been heard from for a while and no-one has done anything about it, but decide to head south to get some potions!

### Chapter 14
##### Umbrage

Built on the slope of Umbrage Hill is an old stone windmill surrounded by an iron fence. A large winged monster with a spiky tail is trying to knock down the windmill’s front door. A woman appears in a second-floor window, waves at the group, and yells, “A little help?!”

The group stand well back, the beast has not spotted them yet. Minogar turns to Mira and asks if she knows what it is. He recognises it as a Manticore, a ferocious beast that is strange to be spotted so close to a human settlement, he explains that some are known to speak common and that if they were to attack it chances are it would not end well for them.

<div class="descriptive">
“Manticores love the taste of human flesh. That’s why, on trips through the mountains, I always travel with human guards.”

— Marthok Uldarr, dwarf copper merchant
</div>

Marlade nudges Sasha and says she should be the one to talk to the Manticore. The group all move forward and shove Sasha ahead slightly. The manticore stops attacking the door and slowly turns to the group.

The manticore begins to step towards the group and Marcus shouts asking it to leave the door alone. It explains that it needs food and is starving, normally he would just hunt around it's normal habitat but it has been kicked out.

It explains further, that a white dragon came into his lair and made it flee, this is the only piece of food it has found for days.

"I am not a piece of food!" the old woman shouts.

Sasha pleads with the manticore to leave the woman alone and find food somewhere else, "I regret to have to do this, but it is the natural way" the manticore says.

Minogar thinks quickly, he tells the manticore that there are some recently dead goblins near a cave in Phandalin, why not head there?

Slowly, the manticore approaches the goliath. By comparison the goliath - who is usually towering - is made to look quite meek in the manticore's presence. Minogar sees the beast's almost human face as it comes so close as to feel its warm breath on his face. The beast slowly smiles revealing razor sharp teeth of multiple rows.
```
```
Whoosh! The manticore quickly darts to it's right and launches into the air, it's monstrous wings carrying it off into the distance. Minogar unclenches and relaxes. Marcus states to the group the power of asking nicely, as they head inside the windmill to meet the old woman.

Inside, the old woman introduces herself as Adabra, and thanks the group for saving her and says the group can have a reward. The group ask her to help the boy from earlier and that they need a potion of healing from her.

She hobbles over to her desk and opens a drawer, she pulls out six potions and hands one to each member of the party, she gives Sasha a second one,  "For the boy." she says. The group thank the old woman and quickly head back to town.

When they return to the farmhouse, they see that Harbin Wester - the Townmaster - is now also there, looking concerned at the boy. He thanks the heroes for their deeds as Sasha offers the potion to Qelline, the halfling takes the potion and thanks the Elf Bard. She sheepishly offers it to the boy and tips it into his mouth.

The group wait.

And wait.

And wait.

Sadly, nothing appears to happen, the boy remains still.

Harbin pipes up, saying he believes he knows of two potential ways to fix this problem. He explains they could either seek the inventive help of the Gnomes to the south in Gnomengarde, about a days journey or head further north for about five days to Thundertree and seek out an old druid by the name of Reidoth.

The group ponder for a moment and decide to try enlisting the help of the gnomes first, in the hopes they have an invention to remove the curse.

### Chapter 15
##### Gnomengarde

As the group head out of town and south they follow a stream uphill to the base of a mountain, where waterfall erosion has carved out a natural concavity. The roaring waterfall creates a cloud of mist as it plunges into a shallow pool of water, within which rise two small islands covered with two-foot-tall red, green, and purple mushrooms. Several cave openings overlook the pool from rocky ledges twenty to thirty feet above. The mountain blocks any sunlight from reaching this place.

Choosing the eastern most entrance, the group enter into the dwelling. The corridors are dank and Minogar has to slouch slightly to accomodate his large frame. The group turn the first corner they reach to the right.

"WHAM!" the group are scattered as something BIG hits them all and throws them every which way. Stunned the group see a massive behemoth of a tank, complete with four crossbows that has just fired a huge bolt in their direction. A gnome is seen on top piloting the mech, shouting something about destroying a monster, visibly insane.

Quickly, the group rank up and begin to take out each crossbow bolt, working together as best they can. After destroying the first crossbow, Marlade swings at another crossbow, but drops his mace. Fortunately as he goes to pick it up, the crossbow fires and narrowly misses the cleric as he bends over. Marlade realises what has just happened and thanks Savras - his chosen deity.

The group continue to dismantle the machine,

Mira swoops in and attacks the final crossbow slashing it with her two swords, and the machine falls apart.

In the rubble, a female rock gnome is visible, she is currently dazed. Minogar goes over and lifts her up, asking what that was all about.

```
```

The gnome gives Minogar a surly look and explains that a few gnomes have mysteriously disappeared recently and it has made her super jumpy. She explains that to her, five unknown large figures just burst into her workshop so she felt she needed to defend herself.

Minogar asks where the leader of the gnomes is. The gnome explains that the king has locked himself away in his quarters since the disappearances started happening, reports from other gnomes say he has gone mad. He asks the gnome what her name is, "Facktore" she replies. Minogar laughs at the name and the gnome grows visibly upset.

The group ask her to lead them to the king, but she refuses, explaining that she needs to carry on with her inventions and that she now suddenly has a lot more work to do now that her mech has been so kindly destroyed.

She at least gives the group directions to the king, explaining that the easiest way is as follows; "Head south, then west, across the bridge, keep heading west - oh, and beware the fans - and the throne room is the western most point of Gnomengarde"

Minogar releases the gnome, but places her on a high shelf so she cant get down.

The group decide now would be a good time to rest, and set up camp back outside. Sasha plays the song of rest and the group go to sleep.

## Session 04 - 17/04/2020
### Chapter 16
##### Shoes

The group wake up to a new day, fully recharged, Sasha complains that they ended up setting up camp in the water! They decide to resume their exploration where they left off and head back inside to Facktore's workshop.

Arriving in Facktore's workshop they see the familiar destroyed contraption from earlier, but do not see the pesky gnome at all.

They search around the room incase she is hiding, Minogar checks the shelf he left her on from before.

On the shelf is a pair of gnome shoes, where Facktore once stood. Minogar keeps looking around the room and inspects her worktable, he checks underneath but does not see anything. On top of the worktable are some blueprints in gnomish, which he cannot read.

He asks the rest of the group if anyone can read gnomish. Sasha says she can read dwarven, which does share a common alphabet, but is also unable to read it.

Sasha grabs a shoe and takes a closer look, she looks inside and notices the shoes is a bit wet, it is covered in saliva.
The group realise it seems she has been eaten.

Minogar laughs and says they took her only defence away, but looks concerned.

They press on, and head south to a junction, they can see a room of barrels to the left and a room to the south.
They head south, and hear a pair of voices.

"Who goes there?" The group look up and see a ledge with two gnomes stood on top of it, pointing two crossbows at the group.
Minogar tries to tell them that they are friendly.

"Are you shapechangers? We have orders to kill shapechangers on sight!" the male one asks, the female elbows him in the ribs and says, "We aren't supposed to tell them!", she turns to the group, "Prove you are who you say you are!"

Minogar says to the gnomes that they have already killed a shapechanger before and are actually the perfect candidates to help them.

The gnomes seem perplexed, unsure whether to believe this tale, they ask what this shapechanger looked like. Minogar tells them about how they captured a drunkard named Lanar and took him on their adventures together, they laughed toghether, they cried together, they made promises for each others future together... but ultimately it was a ruse, Lanar was not real. He was a doppelganger manipulating them for it's own gain. It stabbed them in the back, and Minogar will never forget that day. Marlade laughs at the tale.

The male gnome tries to relate saying that yes, its always the ones you least suspect! Next thing you know you are being gobbled up if you arent careful! He continues on to explain that the King has hidden himself away in his chambers since gnomes started vanishing. As far as they know, at least two have gone missing!

Minogar asks what exactly is attacking them, but the gnomes cannot say, anyone who comes across it seems to go missing. Mira then asks why are you so sure its shapechangers?

The gnomes explain that that is their best guess, as no one has seen any monster yet. They go on to ask the group if they have seen anything suspicious?

The group look at one another and aren't sure what to say. "We notice you came from Facktore's workshop, is she ok?" the gnome asks.

Minogar quickly deflects and ask them if they have seen Facktore.

They explain that they last saw her about an hour ago they think, she was muttering something to herself angrily that she is going to have rebuild something. "So, have you guys seen Facktore then?" the gnomes press.

They lie and say they have not.

Mira says they really do need to speak to their king though, "Ah yes, so as we said earlier, the king has locked himself away in his room." the gnomes go on to offer directions to the kings chambers and ask the group to try and negotiate with him to come out.

As they are giving directions they realise that the group are going to get stuck as the gnomes have set a trap that only someone small can disable. The male one offers to go with them and introduces himself as Pog. The other one also says her name is Ulla.

Mira turns to the rest of the group so that the gnomes can't hear and explains that shouldn't they be honest and tell them about Facktore, as it's going to become obvious soon if the gnome comes with them? Minogar says to Mira that surely they are mistaken, and that Facktore is still alive if these guards saw her an hour ago? Mira says how does he know that it didn't happen super recently? Marlade also agrees that it could have happened recently and they should assume the worst.

Minogar turns to the gnomes and swallows, he changes his story from earlier and explains that they infact may have been into Facktore's workshop. But when they went in it was already totally destroyed, they didn't do anything, honest! But they also found her shoes, covered in her saliva, they think...

Ulla says to Pog that perhaps he should check on Facktore first, Pog is scared and asks the group if they would go with him, to which they agree. They head back into Facktore's room.

Pog sees Facktore's shoe on the shelf and reaches up to try and grab it. The gnome struggles for some time before Minogar decides to pass the shoe to him, but dangles it slowly above him first.

Pog grabs it quickly, and gives Minogar a look. He inspects the shoe and says it is definitely Facktore's. He pleads with the group to help the gnomes as they are dropping like flies.

Mira asks Pog if he could take a look at the notes that Minogar tried to read earlier, Pog agrees and looks at Facktore's blueprints. "Rotate this, this goes in here, thats a question mark, gear and lever maybe needed for this bit" Pog says aloud reading what he can.

The group start to converse and try to work out where this monster could be located, they decide that they haven't tried north yet and ask Pog what is north of here. "There is a dining room, then a kitchen, oh and also a place where we store some battle crabs!" Pog also says that during this time of day, the kitchen will be very busy.

Mira asks Pog to take them to the kitchen, Pog does so, and takes them through an empty dining room first, complete with miniature tables and chairs. He explains that as it is early, the dining room is usually empty.

Pog shows them a closed door and says this is the kitchen. He advises them to knock first, as it is likely to be busy.
\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
### Chapter 17
##### Kitchen

Marlade says to Pog to go in first, but he refuses saying he doesn't want to be told off by Panana.

Minogar tells the group to stand back, he goes to get ready to kick the door down, but Mira stops him and says that they should just knock first. Minogar relents, and begudgingly agrees to just knock.

They hear a female squeaky voice on the other side, "Who is it?", the voice is agitated. Minogar says they are friends of Facktore. "Facktore? What does Facktore want now?!", the voice grows impatient. Minogar explains that they believe that Facktore has gone missing, the voice cuts him off. "Oh for Nebulun's sake! We are super busy, we have like twenty mouths to feed, can't Facktore wait!?"

> ##### Nebulun
> Nebulun is the god of invention and luck, gnomes of Gnomengarde have him as their chosen deity. His domain is both Knowledge and Trickery and so his followers can be seen as a little chaotic. His symbol is the Bellows and a lizard tail.

Minogar says they won't be long, they just want to poke their heads in. The voice shouts back into the room, "Turvaround, come here and talk to these idiots!"

Some shuffling is heard and another female voice is heard, different to the first, "Ugh, hello?"

Minogar looks confused but answers the voice, he explains that they have lost Facktore and want to see if she is in there.

"Facktore, not again, she's always causing trouble. She is not in here!!"

Minogar says he thinks she might be dead.

The voice says, "Oh, she had died?" the voice turns back into the room and the group can hear her say, "Uhm, Panana, apparently Facktore, has, died..." The group can hear in the distance the first voice replying back, "Facktore? Facktore has died?" the voice pauses for a second, "Look at how much of a crap i DONT give!! Get back on with the cooking!!"

The voice at the door goes, "Ok" and it speaks through the door once again, "Look, unless you have ingredients or want to help us with preparing the food, we aren't interested. Go away!"

Mira tries to reason with the voice, and says they just want to be quick and take a look, they will be on their way afterwards.

The voice explains that if she did let them in, Panana would be mad. Mira asks who Panana is, and the voice says Panana is the boss, the one the group spoke to first. Minogar laughs and mocks the name.

The voice now appears to be shouting back into the room, "Im trying to get rid of them! They won't go!".

Marlade turns to Minogar and says maybe he had the right plan in the first place. Minogar says right I'm busting this door down! He goes into the door with all his might, the gnome on the other side resists it somewhat but is ultimately beaten and flung from the door. The door swings open and the group see into the kitchen.

This kitchen is furnished with gnomes in mind, so everything is either close to the floor or readily reachable by tugging on an overly complicated rope-and-pulley mechanism. Five rock gnome recluses busy themselves here as a female gnome uses a poker to stoke the fire of a hot iron stove standing against the east wall.

Another uses a complicated press-like contraption to squeeze oil out of a big red mushroom and filter the liquid into four oil flasks.

Another stands atop a low table and uses a mechanical rolling pin contraption to kneed green bread dough. The severed caps of several big green mushrooms are set around her.

A male gnome forms the dough into loaves of green bread, his tongue sticking out as he carefully shapes each loaf like a master sculptor.

Finally, another female gnome is now dazed on the floor, presumably the one holding the door just now. Minogar feels sorry for the gnome but says they won't be long they just want a quick look around. The gnome begrudingly carry on with their work.

Minogar goes to the gnome on the floor and helps her up, he offers her a silver coin. She takes it and says "What was that for?" Minogar apologises to the gnome and says he needs to find Facktore.

The gnome gets annoyed and says, "I already told you! She isn't in here! I know goliaths aren't supposed to be the brighest, but Nebulun help me!! This is ridiculous" as she rubs the back of her head.

Minogar gets annoyed but Marlade puts his hand on his shoulder and winks, explaining that there is a body of water outside if they come to need it.

Minogar inspects the staff in the kitchen and goes up to Panana, he feels that she is infact a gnome. Panana calms down, and levels with the group, she advises them to seek out the two inventors Fibblestib and Dabbledob, as they are the smartest in all of Gnomengarde.

The whole group immediately start laughing at the names of the gnomes. Panana snaps and says that gnomish names are not funny and should be respected. She gets annoyed and snaps at Pog, "Seeing as you seem to be accompanying this group, why not take them to the inventors workshop?"

The group thank Panana, and Marlade heads to the back of the kitchen to the pantry. This room is piled high with small wooden crates. Each contains loaves of green mushroom bread and other foodstuffs collected and kept by the gnomes. He decides that now is not quite the time to be stealing from these gnomes. He says maybe later we shall steal something.

Pog asks Marlade what he just said, Marlade says maybe later we shall eat something. Pog says that later you can eat all the rewards you want! But first you must help us out. Pog realises that it will be up to the king what the adventurers get, "I mean, Ill try my best to convince the King to reward you! I promise!".

Marlade says he will just take Pog if not.

Pog smiles and says it is forbidden to leave Gnomengarde as a gnome!

The group decide to head back south and get pog to lead them, they head back a slightly different way and go past the battle crab room.

### Chapter 18
##### Ulla

Parked in alcoves in this otherwise empty room are two gnomish contraptions. Each resembles a crab with a barrel for a shell, six articulated metal legs, and a pair of forward-facing pincer claws. A hatch on the top of each barrel opens to reveal an interior compartment equipped with a small, leather-padded seat surrounded by levers, pedals, and gears. The barrels are not airtight.

The gnomes built these crablike contraptions to grip and move other objects, rather like crude forklifts. However, the contraptions are so clumsy that they are useless for delicate work. They are just small enough to navigate Gnomengarde’s 5-foot-wide passageways.

Marlade asks Pog if this room is dangerous, Pog explains that Facktore made these as a defence incase they are ever attacked, they are harmless while no one is piloting them. Marlade asks if any are likely to blow up, Pog assures him that they are safe, and that the chances of them fitting inside are small anyways.

Marlade asks if there is a threat of shapechangers happening right now, why aren't they being used? Pog explains that they have an issue in the tight corridors of turning the crabs around. "But, I hear that Facktore has been working on a much better invention with crossbows and everything! Come, let me show you now!"

Marlade interupts and says he hears the invention is not so good. Sasha goes up an investigates one of the crabs, she thinks that one of them could fit inside, but it would be a squeeze.

The group decide to leave the crabs for now and carry on heading south back to where they met Pog. On the way they pass through Facktore's room and Minogar makes a joke that Facktore should really tidy up the place.

As they approach the room with Ulla, Pog rushes ahead, but they hear him shouting in a panic, "Ulla, Ulla? Where have you gone?"

Pog rushes up to the ledge where she once stood and breaks down, sobbing. The group go up and inspect the area for clues but can't find any. Marlade tries to console Pog, but he comes across as insincere. Mira just says can we go to the inventors workshop already?

Pog looks up snivelling, and explains that the kings orders were for a gnome to always be guarding this spot, and with Ulla being eaten, his duty falls on him to remain here.

Minogar picks up Pog like a baby and cuddles him, saying all will be ok. "Oooh, you are very warm... goliath..." Pog says. Minogar swiftly puts the gnome back down and walks away disgusted. Pog sits there and pouts.

Pog at least says to the group that he can give alternate directions to avoid the trap they have set, and so the group begin to head back out.

To the west, a female gnome comes walking in. Pog looks like he has seen a ghost and starts shouting. "Ulla?! You're alive!!"

"Yes, im alive, whats the problem?" Ulla begins to look confused. "We thought you were dead!" Pog shouts. Sasha says to Ulla that she thought she would have been watching this spot. Ulla explains she just nipped outside to "relieve" herself. 

Sasha explains to Ulla that Pog assumed she had been got by the monster.

"Oh he is so dramatic isnt he!" Ulla says, "I'm surprised you have kept him with you this long, he can be so annoying!"
"Pog," she continues, "Go and show them to the King's chamber or wherever you were going, let me get back up there."

Mira and Marlade aren't sure and both look closely at Ulla, they think she is normal though. Pog offers to take the group further into Gnomengarde, they head west back into the outside, a rope bridge is before them, the waterfall gushing away to it's left.

### Chapter 19
##### Inventors

The waterfall plunges 60 feet, its mist lightly obscuring a 35-foot-long rope bridge firmly anchored to 20-foot-high ledges. The bridge looks to be perilous to cross, and sags so that its midpoint is only 15 feet above the water. 

Pog skips across the bridge and turns back to the group, realising they haven't followed him across, "Follow me!" he shouts.

The group cross one by one, they all make it across, Minogar is last to cross. His large goliath frame is probably not going to serve him well here, he thinks.

Pog starts to chant, "Minogar, Minogar!" and the rest of the group do as well. Minogar walks across, and makes it to the other side, breathing heavily. Pog jokes that they have gone the wrong way and need to go back.
\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<img

  style='position: absolute; left: -140px; bottom: 50px;' />

Pog leads them from the bridge back into the mountainside, inside they see a new room. This area is lightly obscured by mist from the waterfall. The larger eastern part of the room contains two rapidly spinning devices that look like turnstiles fitted with stacks of long, sharp blades spaced 1 foot apart. The northern turnstile spins counterclockwise, while the southern one spins clockwise.

Pog scampers off underneath the fans as though they aren't there and disappears around a corner. The group hear a "click" and the fans whir and slow down to a stop. They hear Pog shout its safe and to follow.

The group navigate around the fan blades, their razor sharpness is apparent as they glint in the dim light from the entrance. When the group are all safely past, they ask Pog to turn the fans back on, just in case.

Minogar points to the fans, and says "Facktore?" to Pog. Pog isn't sure what he means, and Minogar clarifies that he is asking if Facktore made these. "Oh no, these were made by the great Fibblestib and Dabbledob! Infact, they are just through here, come, come!" Pog leads the group on.

As the characters approach this area, they overhear an argument in Gnomish between two rock gnome recluses — a male named Fibblestib and a female named Dabbledob. As Gnomengarde’s foremost inventors, they are trying to dream up an invention that will cure King Korboz’s madness. Fibblestib’s proposal is a “sanity ray.” Dabbledob thinks that’s dumb, and wants to build something called a “straitjacket” instead.

The two gnomes hear the group arrive and ask them which invention they believe has more merit, the group decide on "straitjacket". Dabbledob goes to high five Mira for suggesting it, and has to jump to met her palm.

Minogar asks what the hell they are actually talking about, Fibblestib explains that the king has locked himself away, they believe he has lost his mind and are thinking up inventions they could build to restore it.

Sasha asks if they have seen Facktore recently, they say they think they spoke to her last a few days ago, but try to avoid her when they can. The gnomes offer to give them directions to Facktore's workshop, but Sasha says they suspect she has gone missing.
```
```

"Not another one!" Dabbledob exclaims. The gnomes explain to the group that they would help the gnomes out to try and prevent the disappearances, but their priority is the king's health right now. Fibblestib says that the King can be really dramatic, but then realises what he said, "Please don't tell him I said that!"

Sasha assures the gnomes they won't say anything, but asks why he is being dramatic. The gnomes believe he has locked himself away after hearing of the disturbances, fearing for his own life. Sasha asks the gnomes if they could arrange a way for them to speak with him, to which the gnomes advise to just knock on his door, they say he is at least speaking to people. But not making much sense.

The group asks where the king is, and Pog offers to guide them. Marlade realises that these could be the inventors that the Townmaster wanted them to find, Sasha says before they go and see the king, would the inventors be able to help them?

She tells them of the cursed boy and if they know a way to cure it? The inventors say certainly and ask her to describe the curse. Marlade says that the curse responds to healing in an inverse fashion and seems to do damage.

The gnomes whisper amongst themselves for a moment and then face the group looking like they have solved it.

"Have you tried..." Fibblestib says slowly, "A potion... of healing?"

The group tell him that they have tried that and it doesnt work. His face quickly drops, "Oh. Well erm..." The gnomes talk amongst themselves again, a bit more energised. The group hear them mutter, that could work, that wont work, we could try, there is only one way to know!

The gnomes turn again, they say they know what invention to build and will help the group after they have helped them with the king.

The group follow Pog north from the workshop to the king's chambers

### Chapter 20
##### Korboz

The group arrive at a door, this one different to the ones they have seen so far in Gnomengarde, this one has a regal quality to it. It's crafting ornate, and the colour of which is a deep scarlet with gold trimmings.

They bicker amongst themselves as to whether they should knock again or just kick it down. Mira says she wants to just knock, but Marlade and Minogar want to just drag the king out and throw him infront of the inventors. Minogar asks everyone to stand back as he prepares to knock down the door.

"Please don't do that!" Pog pleads with Minogar, "I will get in trouble!"
Minogar just tells Pog to wear a fake mustache and all will be fine. Pog takes this as his queue to run away, he does not want to risk it.

Before Minogar can kick the door down, Mira insists they just knock and stops him. He goes up to the door and knocks himself. He hears a strange voice on the other side, "Whooo iisss ittt??". The voice sounds unhinged and crazy.

Mira says they are here to save you.

"My fwends have come to saaavveee meee have theyyyy??" the voice pauses and shouts, "Nice try! But im not opening that door!"
\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<img

  style='position: absolute; right: -40px; bottom: 0px;' />

"I'm gonna keep my Gnerlki safe with meeee"

Mira tries again, and says they are just trying to help.

"I bet you are," the voice says, "I bet you are trying to help me be... conssuuuuummmeeeddd..."

Mira starts to get annoyed and asks why he would lock himself away while gnomes are being killed.

"Its the only way to be safe, Its the only way to be safe", the voice keeps repeating. Mira says he understands but they are trying to help.

"SHUSH GNERKLI, they can't hear you!" the voice shouts. The group hear a muffled voice in the background of the room.

"Lock myself away, its the only way to be safe, Lock myself away, its the only way to be safe" the voice starts repeating again.

Mira turns to Minogar and says ok kick the door down.

Sasha mentions that have they even checked if the door is locked, so they check.

Its locked.

The group stands back and Minogar prepares to rush forwards to kick the door. Sasha starts to play her flute to inspire Minogar.

"Muuuusssiiccc, i hear muuuussssiiiccc" the voice says.

Minogar slams into the door with all his might and tries to kick it in, but the door is too sturdy and barely moves. He damages his foot.

Marlade decides that now is the time.

He is also unsuccessful and hurts his foot on the door also.

Minogar sighs and decides to knock again.

"Knocking! Knocking! Why always knocccckkkkiiiinnnnggggg?" the voice shouts.

Minogar goes close to the door, and professes his love for the king infront of everyone in an attempt to get him to open the door. He says he has many trinkets and gifts for the king, he runs his fingers across the door and hopes he can return his love.

There is no response.

Minogar sighs and levels with the king, he says he knows they have an issue with a shapechanger and that they have killed these before and genuinely here to help. Minogar listens closely to the door to try and hear his response but it sounds like the king left long ago, and is further back in the room shouting at whoever he has captive. The king hadn't been listening.

Left with little option, the group head back to the inventors. On the way they see a door that they hadnt been through, as Pog was no longer with them, they decide to enter.

The door is unlocked and leads to the room with the inventors inside, but on a ledge further up. The only thing of note up here is a pedastal that has a closed book on it.

The title is written in gnomish but in brackets underneath in common it reads "Magick of Gnomengarde".

Minogar reads the spells, then attempts to take the book, however the book explodes and he is sent flying backwards. He picks himself up and dusts himself down, then the group carry on back to the inventors.

"Ah, did you speak to the king?" Dabbledob asks, she also mentions she saw Pog running through earlier, crying.

Minogar says not to worry about Pog, he is always crying, but if they see him with a mustache, they should send him their way.

He also mentions to the inventors that they didn't have much luck with the king.

The gnomes hear this and say they did warn the group he had gone insane.

The group ask the gnomes about a potential other person in that room, they think they heard?

The inventors explain that that is likely Gnerkli, the other King. Korboz has hidden him in his room to keep him "safe".

Mira asks if they have any explosives. The gnomes say Facktore would have been the best person to ask about that, she makes all the weaponised inventions. They go on to say that their inventions are way more sophisticated, but strictly non-militant, so can't really help the group here.

Minogar doesn't buy their claim that their inventions are superior and mentions he thinks that that "straitjacket" idea earlier was stupid. He asks if they have any idea of any leads at all to find this monster?

The gnomes explain that the first two people to go missing both worked in the storeroom, they say it is a room full of barrels near Facktore's workshop. Mira asks when this all first started, "Ah, about a tenday ago," Fibblestib says.

The group decide their best shot is to head back to Facktore's room and try to find the barrel room.

### Chapter 21
##### Hunt

Leaving the inventor's workshop, the group once again enter the room with the fans, which are still spinning from earlier. They hit the switch to turn them off and proceed through.

Sasha casts Mage Hand and uses it to flick on the switch again, the fans start spinning again.

She tries to bring the hand back to her, but it fizzles away as soon as it returns.
\page

> ##### Mage Hand
> A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
>
>You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
>
>The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

They arrive at the rope bridge again, Minogar panics and bolts it across the bridge. The rest of the group follow normally.

Once again, they find themselves in the room with the gnome guards, Pog has returned to Ulla and they are both stood atop the ledge.

"Any luck?" Ulla asks

The group continue on but mention to Ulla that they think they now know where the monster is.

They come to a fork where one side leads back to Facktore's workshop, the other leads to a room that has barrels in it, the group head in.

This room contains twelve forty-gallon barrels set into wide alcoves. Each barrel is secured by a wooden brace. The barrels in the south alcove have been tapped with wooden spigots. Two of those barrels are half full, and two are nearly empty.

The group split up and begin to investigate all the barrels.

It seems that the barrels are all looking to be normal, but Mira goes to one in the far corner and taps it with his hand.

Suddenly the barrel begins to morph and a purple tendril forms and tries to grab him, but his reflexes are sharp and he leaps back to avoid it. The tendril starts to flail about and the barrel continues to morph. It sprouts multiple eyes and a gaping maw for a mouth with razor sharp teeth, smiles at the group.

Mira rushes forwards and slashes at it with both of his swords.

In the panic however, he misses with both swipes and the beast - the mimic - once again tries to grab him. It succeeds and wraps its long pseudopod around him and constricts. Mira screams in pain.

Minogar draws his greataxe and rushes forward, he slips on a puddle of wine on the floor and goes crashing into another set of barrels. Some of the wine from the barrels starts to drip into his open mouth.

Marlade loads his crossbow and fires at the mimic, hitting it in it's eye. The mimic screams out in agony but keeps its grip on Mira.

Sasha moves closer to the fray and throws a dagger at the beast, but sadly misses and hits the wall behind it. She then decides to take out her flute and boost the morale of the group.

Mira hears the tune and with new found vigor, attacks at the mimic with her swords, making contact this time and leaving the creature looking rather bloody.

The creature is persistent though and remains in control of Mira, it lunges forwards and tries to bite. But Mira is able to push it back and avoid being bitten.

Minogar picks himself up, and takes another swig of wine. He swings his greataxe into the monsters bulbous flesh and the monster squeals. The purple flesh bounces against the axe but he is able to create a decent tear.

Marlade casts guiding bolt at the creature, as four bolts of light are summoned and smash into the mimic, dazing it.

After this act, the monster calms down and releases Mira. It starts to murmur in common, "ssstttooppp, pleeeasssee" it hisses.

The group initially lower their weapons, and look at each other confused. Sasha casts blade ward on herself to increase her defence just incase.

Mira looks over at the mimic and asks who it is, and if it knows whats happening to the gnomes.

The mimic licks its lips and says "Of course, I know whats happening to the gnomes, they're delicous!".

Mira realises the mimic is the one who is eating them.

"Initially they were tough, with not much meat, but i've grown quite a taste for them!"

Mira goes on to ask why gnomes though?

"Normally, I wouldn't even eat gnomes but ive been forced to relocate"

Mira asks who sent the mimic here.

"Nobody sent me here, I was driven out, it was that darn dragon, I had to run and hide in this cave as it flew around overhead, and as i was hiding, this little gnome came wandering in looking for wine. So i gobbled him up! Easy pickings i say."

Mira asks what the creature would normally eat instead of gnomes.

"Normally... adventurers... like you" the mimic gives them a toothy grin.
\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

Minogar then asks the mimic why should they keep it alive in that case?

"If you let me live, I swear, I will leave this place and never return."

> ##### Mimic
Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.
>
><div class="descriptive">“Sometimes a chest is just a chest, but don’t bet on it.”

> — X the Mystic’s 3rd rule of dungeon survival</div>

Mira and Minogar look at each other and both shake their heads, Minogar turns to the mimic and says it is gonna have to better than that.

"Is that so," the mimic ponders for a second.

Realising it has no choice, it begins to fight to the death and lunges once again at Mira.

Mira slashes with her sword reactively, and the beast squeals out in pain and begins to melt. It slowly becomes a purple puddle on the floor before slowly seeping into the stone and leaving a dark mark where it once stood.

Minogar goes over to the puddle and inspects it, there are multiple bones and bits of skeleton. He sees a small skull and picks it up, presumably Facktore's skull. He decides to take it with him.

The group decide now is the time to tell the king what they know.

### Chapter 22
##### Aftermath

On the way back to the inventors, they once again pass the two guards.

"I heard a lot of commotion," Ulla says, "Are you guys alright?"

Minogar says they found the monster, turns out it was a mimic that had been eating all the gnomes and it was hiding in the barrel room.

"Of course Pog!", Ulla shouts, "It was in the storeroom! Thats where they both worked, Orryn and Warryn! They worked in the storeroom!"

Minogar says they still need to get an audience with the king to tell him its safe.

Mira says they have Facktore's skull but are unsure if thats enough to prove it to the king.

The guards decide to tell the group about a hidden passage in the rear of the throne room that will take them straight into the king's bedchamber. They tell the group that to get to the throne room the must head once again to the inventor's workshop and head as west as far as they can.

The group continue on, they cross the rope bridge and stand outside the room with the fans. Sasha once again casts mage hand to disable the fans. But as she casts her spell, large butterfly wings also sprout from her back. She turns around confused, as she had not intended to also do that?

With the fans disabled, the group head through into the inventors room.

"How did it go?" Fibblestib asks before realising what has happened to Sasha. Both gnomes suddenly burst into laughter.

"Ahaha, you must have cast a spell didn't you?"

Sasha asks if they like her new wings.

The gnomes explain that Gnomengarde was built in a magical place and its walls are coursing with wild magic.

> ##### Wild Magic
> Wild magic is a kind of magic that can’t be controlled, and Gnomengarde has long been a source of it. When a creature anywhere in Gnomengarde map casts a spell, an additional effect might occur.

Sasha explains that they found Facktore, but not in the way they wanted too, as Minogar shows them the skull.

The gnomes recoil in fear and ask if the group did that. The group reply no and that it was a mimic that ate her, and that they have defeated the beast.

"Ah, thats probably what caused the king to go mad, I bet some object morphed and attacked him, and thats why he doesnt trust anyone!"

The gnomes point the group in the direction of the throne room, and the group arrive at two shut large wooden doors, with a wooden beam closing them.

Marlade lifts off the wooden beam and the group slowly open the door.

The room is not lit at all, so Minogar lights a torch.

The throne room is the biggest room they have seen here so far, but is mostly empty, towards the back situated atop a stone dais are two squat thrones made of scrap metal and sized for gnomes. 

The group move over behind the thrones and inspect the back wall. Sasha sees the outline of what appears to be a secret door.

Marlade sweats.

Marlade goes up to the door and takes a deep breath, it opens no problem.

Minogar leads the way with his torch into the dark corridor, it appears to lead to a dead end, but they see light seeping through some cracks and realise it is another secret door, they open it and enter.

They see an extremely well furnished room, this is clearly the domain of someone very important. However, everything that could be counted as furniture is pushed up against the main door to this room.

In the centre they see two gnomes, both wearing crowns. One is staring at the group in horror, the other is tied to a chair with a sock in his mouth.

Sasha speaks to the gnome who is stood up, who they believe to be King Korboz.
\page
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<img 
  src='https://imgur.com/2RxIuw8.png' 
  style='position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: 0px;' />

She says they have found who has been killing the gnomes and that they have proof.

"Proof! Proof? You say you have proof! Gnomes have been killed" Korboz rambles.

Korboz freezes for a moment, and it appears that he has become more lucid.

His demeanor changes and he starts to sound more regal and calm.

"You found the monster did you? Its all over?"

Sasha explains the incident with the mimic.

"Ah, that explains everything," he turns to the other king in the chair, "Gnerkli, it was a mimic."

Gnerkli tries to say something, but the sock muffles it. Korboz goes over to the chair and remove the sock from Gnerkli's mouth, he takes out a vial and drips it onto what appears to be glue holding Gnerkli to the chair. Gnerkli gets up and thanks the adventurers.

Sasha asks who this person is who was tied to the chair, the kings explain that they rule together and introduce themselves properly.

The group ask Korboz why he tied the other king to the chair, and Korboz explains that it was for his own protection. The group seem concerned about his methods, but carry on.

Gnerkli gives the group a look as if to say "help me" but is smiling on the outside.

Minogar kneels down to Gnerkli and asks if he is ok. Gnerkli says he will be fine, and offers them a reward for their troubles.

Mira explains about the cursed boy that they need to save, Gnerkli says that their best inventors should be able to help them. Mira tells the king that they wont help until they know you are ok.

Minogar also pipes up and says what about if the reward is treasure instead? Korboz says, "Of course, if it is treasure you covet, you may have that instead."

The group decide that it would be best to save the boy. Korboz smiles and says you can have both.

Gnerkli leads the group into the treasure room, he unlocks the door and the group goes inside. The room contains a jumble of nonfunctional gnomish gizmos, as well as loose gears, twisted bits of metal, and other scraps that the gnomes use to cobble together new inventions.

Gnerkli pulls out an amulet from the pile and gives it to Mira, he pulls out a pole and shows that it can retract and expand on command and hands it to Minogar.

The group thank the king but seem disappointed. The gnome king laughs and says he will stop messing with them, he pulls out a chest and gives the group 250 gold pieces to split amongst them. The group then head back to the inventors with Gnerkli to explain that the king is well and to get their invention made.

Fibblestib and Dabbledob see their king alive and well, and ask the group what they needed making again. Sasha reminds them about the cursed boy and the inventors turn to their workstation and start banging and whirring and swearing.

"Ahah!" they turn around and give a gizmo that they hand to Mira, it has a gem on top with 4 legs and a big button that says "Press Here".

Minogar looks at the invention and asks if they can write the instructions in Giant. "Right away" the gnomes excitadly say, and begin to engrave.

"Errm, what is giant for 'Press Here'?"

Minogar spells it out and they oblige. He looks delighted at the new message (which secretly says 'Nipple Juice') but he isn't going to tell anyone.

The group now decide now is the time to head back to Phandalin with their invention, the wave goodbye and head out of the inventors room. This time they head north into a new room they havent been in yet.

The floor of this cave is strewn with the remnants of old campfires. Four side caves serve as sleeping areas, with five small wooden cots crammed into each one. Eight rock gnome recluses sleep soundly here with two gnomes in each side cave.

The group attempt to quietly sneak past to the other exit that leads outside, but Marlade shouts to find out why the rest of the group are sneaking.

"Whats all the shouting?" one of the gnomes rises up from his slumber and says, rubbing her eyes.

Minogar just says they are on their way out.

The half asleep gnome just says "Ah ok, carry on then" probably still dreaming and slams back to sleep once again.

The group exit the room and are now on a 30 foot ledge above the waters they saw when they entered the area. Sasha decides to try out her new butterfly wings and grabs Mira and they both flutter gently down to the ground.

Minogar ties Marlade with some rope and gently lowers him down the ledge. The goliath then slides down the ledge no problem.

The group begin to walk back to Phandalin and turn around and look once more at Gnomengarde, and thinking about the adventure they had here.

As the group leave the place, Sasha wings begin to fade as the wild magic wears off...
