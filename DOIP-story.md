# Prelude

The sky is dark, and the air is still. 
A fortress stands proud on the side of a mountain, hugging the side as if holding on for dear life, but the structure is sound, secure, it has stood here for eons and won't falter today. 
Inside, Ugor, the Orc blacksmith smashes down his hammer to forge a new blade. No doubt that this honed edge will slay many an enemy in it's day. Randigar and Serlink - both larger Orcs than Ugor - are keeping watch on the crenellations outside of the castle. Today is no different from any other day and Randigar and Serlink are both being complacent in their duties, very few souls even know of this place's existence, let alone will plan to attack it.

Ugor smashes his hammer down again with a thud, its resonant chime echoing through the chilled halls of the fortress. Randigar cracks a joke and Serlink laughs, a wolf's howl is heard in the distance.

Ugor raises his masterpiece infront of his beady eyes and examines his fine work, he is proud of the edge he has created and it should serve his Orc master well in combat. He dips it into a vat of water with a sharp hissing sound to quench the blade.

Serlink has said something to Randigar that he doesn't like and they start to fall out, they turn away from each other for a little while. As they have nothing better to do, they quickly reconsile and are back to poking fun at each other again.

The air outside begins to howl, it is not unusual for the wind to pick up from time to time up in the mountains, and doesn't cause any concern to inhabitant Orcs. With a sharp blow, the wind howls through into Ugor's room and blows out a few of his candles. He grunts and gets up reluctantly, he carefully relights his candles allowing him to see the room clearly again.

Ugor turns sharply.

He heard something...

Something big.

What sounded like a huge beast roaring in the distance, and almost what sounds like, flapping perhaps?

Randigar heard it too and tells Serlink to be quiet with a sharp hit to his chest. He freezes and points to the sky. Serlink tries to follow his stubby green finger to see where he is pointing, he sees what Randigar sees - heading straight towards them - and his eyes narrow...

## Session 01 - 27/02/2020
### Chapter 1
##### Harbin

The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly aligned with the neighboring Dwarves and Gnomes. Then an Orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.
 
In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.

The heroes are currently sat in the town green, reminiscing about their adventurers of past. Marlade, the Human Cleric is currently telling them all how great the god Savras is, but the other two do not seem interested at all. An Elf Bard, Sasha, is currently tuning her prized lute that she inherited from her noble family. The last member of this party, a hulking Goliath Barbarian named Minogar Threefury towers over them both, laughing at Marlade's futile attempts at conversion.

Harbin Wester, a sorry looking, podgy man is making his way as fast as his feeble body would allow him to shuffle towards the heroes. As he arrives, out of breath, he makes a shrewd comment about how they are "supposedly" adventurers and mentions how he only knows about them thanks to his townsfolk letting him know they are in the area.

He does have a quest to offer the group, however, and offers it forcefully, being too excitable to even wait for a response.

"Ah you must be the would-be adventurers I keep hearing the people gossip about, but I have need your help with an issue, and it must be kept hush-hush as it were" he exclaims with his posh dialect and an inflection of superiority.

"Well, you see, its the farmer's son, he has gone missing" he says with a slight frown which could be mistaken for genuine concern, but is really for his own image than that of the well being of the boy.

He mutters something to himself, forgetting that he is within earshot "Ever since that night when they came...". He realises quickly that he is not alone, "Oh, sorry! Where was I, ignore that, ahem!"

"Hes gone missing, yes, and I need you to search for the poor boy, he must<br/>
be so scared, out<br/>
there on his own,<br/>
poor thing, poor<br/>
thing. I would ask<br/>
around the town<br/>
if I were you,<br/>
surely<br/>
someone<br/>
knows<br/>
something about<br/>
where he would have<br/>
got too. I would do it<br/>
myself of course, but<br/>
you know, the old<br/>
gammy leg playing up<br/>
again HAHA, the old<br/>
leg you see"

Harbin lifts up the bottom of his leg to show the party, it is grim. Sasha recoils slightly and wishes she hadn't looked.

Excitedly, he says "Thanks again, for doing this, just remember I will be in my house if you need me, do let me know when you have found him"

He pauses for a second and says "There will of course be, a reward" gesturing with his hands to indicate financial reward, but doesn't say how much.

Harbin retreats back to the Townmaster's hall as quickly as he came out, onto the next important task he has to do that day.


The group are left a little bewildered by that encounter, but decide to carry out his wishes and ask around town, they head over to the Stonehill Inn first.

> ##### Stonehill Inn
> The Stonehill Inn is the main Inn in Phandalin (but not the only one) it is a family ran business consisting of the Father, Toblen Stonehill, his wife Trilena, and their son Pip.
>
> Often, only the Parents are the ones running the Inn, as Pip is too young to be of much help, he is often found playing in the streets of Phandalin with his best friend Carp.

### Chapter 2
##### Lanar

Inside the Inn, the heroes are greeted with a warm atmosphere and a cosy decor. There is a man sitting alone nursing a pint and two men further into the Inn engaged in conversation, one of them looking like a knight.

Behind the bar are the two owners of the establishment, Toblen and his wife Trilena, looking at the heroes who have just entered.

Marlade immediately goes to sit with the drunk looking man, possibly due to his clerical nature in wanting to help the sick and down trodden. The other two head over to the bar and speak to Toblen.

Minogar walks up to the bar, hunching his back slightly to fit under the comparitively low ceiling, he begins talking to the barkeep - Toblen. He orders 5 ales and pays with a single gold piece. This slightly irks Toblen as he has to go the register and get lots of change out to give back to the goliath.

Sasha asks about the missing boy, Toblen and his wife mention that they didn't even realise the boy was missing.

The heroes tell the couple that the missing boy is the farmer's son but do not know his name.

"Ah, the farmer's boy is named Carp, he plays with our son Pip a lot. To be honest I haven't actually seen him for a couple of days, I never twigged that he had gone missing!" Trilena continues, "You should talk to our son Pip, he is out on the Town Green last I checked!"

The pair take their drinks and turn to sit with the knight and the farmer.

Meanwhile, Marlade is trying to talk to the drunk, but is not making much progress. The drunk is slurring his words and rocking back and forth. "A boy?", the drunk exclaims, "Missing in where you say?"

Marlade groans and continues his endeavour.

Sasha and Minogar have not been noticed by the Knight and Farmer who are talking between themselves, and so they interupt the Knight who is currently talking. He tries to ignore them initially and carry on his conversation, but the pair are persistent and he turns to them, "Do you mind? We are trying to have a conversation here, can you not find somewhere else to sit?".

They ask the knight who he is and what gives him the right to speak to them like that.

"I am a knight of Neverwinter", he says churlishly, "On official business by Lord Dagult Neverember, I am not about to disclose it to peasants such as yourselves. Now if you will excuse me."

He turns back to the farmer and continues his conversation. The adventurers try to instead appeal to the farmer and persuade him to begin a dialog. They ask him about the missing farmer's boy.

"Carp has gone missing?", he asks with a panic, "How long has he been gone?". The pair tell him two days, "Two days?! Wait. Are you sure? He can't have been missing that long. I saw him on the farm yesterday... I was helping him tend to the fields."

They tell him that they are sure he is missing, but he cannot aid them with any information other than what they already know. So they go and sit back with Marlade.

Marlade's patience had grown very thin with the drunken man by this point, however, and he grabs him by the scruf of his neck and leads him out of the Inn. The group follow in a hurry.

A seemingly possessed Marlade, looks around frantically on the doorstep of the inn. He asks the group if they know of any body of water nearby, but they do not. In the center of the town he notices a shrine with a lady kneeling infront of it.

Dragging the reluctant drunk over to the shrine, he notices something odd about the shrine.

> ##### Shrine of Luck
> In the centre of Phandalin is a small outdoor shrine in the shape of a female with her eyes closed. It is dedicated to the goddess Tymora - the goddess of luck - the shrine was built by an inhabitant of the town in order to make it easier to worship.

Angrily, Marlade quickly changes course when he realises the prayer bowl that the elf lady was using is not big enough for what he wants.

Confused, the other two follow him as he drags the poor drunk in the direction of Phandalin's farm.

At the farm, still possessed and quick tempered, Marlade comes up to a water trough - intended for the horses - and throws the drunk down.

Mercilessly, the cleric grabs the back of the drunkards scalp and forces him down into the water, the drunk begins to drown. Nearing his last breath, Marlade lifts his head back out of the water and asks him his name.

Due to this treacherous scenario the drunk finds himself in, he quickly sobers up. "Lanar!! My name is Lanar!!" he exclaims.

Again, the cleric dunks the hapless man, and the other two look on at this spectacle.

Marlade asks him repeatadly where the boy is hidden. Lanar begs the cleric "I do not know, I do not know".

But Marlade isn't satisfied, he knows that Lanar knows something... And will not stop until he knows it too.

This tortuous exercise continues for what seems like an eternity to Lanar, and eventually, he relents. "The boy! The boy! They have taken him into the cave! Please thats all i know!". Marlade asks him who has taken to the cave, "They will kill me if I tell you, I can't".

Back under the water Lanar goes, as Marlade shoves his head down once again. Upon surfacing Lanar trembles, 
<span style="margin-left: 110px">"Please! Please! Im telling you thats</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">all I know, these cultists in black robes</span>
<span style="margin-left: 130px">took him from the farm! They went</span>
<span style="margin-left: 120px">into a cave, but I was too scared to</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">follow! Please! I am but a coward!"</span>

<span style="margin-left: 90px">Marlade stops, feeling pity and a little</span>
<span style="margin-left: 200px">disgust for the poor</span>
<span style="margin-left: 210px">man. The group</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">decide to keep</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">Lanar with them</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">and head to the</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">cave, Lanar is</span>
<span style="margin-left: 240px">forced to lead</span>
<span style="margin-left: 250px">the way.</span>
```
```
### Chapter 3
##### Goblins

Lanar leads the group to the base of the woods south of the ruins of Tresendar Manor.
> ##### Tresendar Manor
> More of a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, and is completely open to the elements nowadays.

As they approach the woods, they see a campfire, reduced to embers. Huddled around this campfire, laughing and snickering, are three Goblins. They are far enough away not to have noticed the adventures, who ready their weapons for combat.

Sasha contemplates what to do for a second and decides to rush in and attack the nearest Goblin with all the might she could muster.

Unfortunately, being a humble bard her attack glances on the Goblin's armor causing no damage and angering it and his accomplices.

Seeing this, Minogar launches a javelin towards the Goblins but it lands short. Meanwhile, Marlade decides to start concentrating on a spell to buff his allies.

The Goblins immediately start wailing on the poor Bard, knocking her unconscious in seconds and one turns his attention to Minogar.

Sasha begins to fade away into the abyss, and Minogar rushes in - his blood boiling. Taking his mighty greataxe in both hands he brings it down hard on the nearest goblin, who is cleft in twain.

Marlade fires his crossbow from distance, and launches an arrow like a bullet straight into the eye of another Goblin, killing it instantly.

Sensing her time is short, Minogar drags Sasha back to the group and Marlade plants his shield in the dirt between her and the remaining Goblin. 

Lanar rushes in seeing Sasha's condition to stabalise her.

Sasha is still unconscious, but thanks to the other two's tremendous bravery, it looks like she might make it.

The remaining Goblin ponders for a second and sees his accomplices dead on the forest floor, he decides to turn tail and run away.

Still raging, Minogar charges through the forest javelin in hand and blood in his eyes for the fleeing Goblin. The Goblin manages to run about 10 feet before it lands right through his vital organs and pins him to the ground. The Goblin writhes for a few seconds, then becomes motionless.

Marlade is tending to Sasha's wounds with his medical kit and manages to just about stabilise her. She gets up slowly, still gravely wounded, but it looks like she has made it and is still alive. For now...

The group turn their attention towards the woods, how will they be press on now?
