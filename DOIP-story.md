# Prelude

The sky is dark, and the air is still. 
A fortress stands proud on the side of a mountain, hugging the side as if holding on for dear life, but the structure is sound, secure, it has stood here for eons and won't falter today. 
Inside, Ugor, the Orc blacksmith smashes down his hammer to forge a new blade. No doubt that this honed edge will slay many an enemy in it's day. Randigar and Serlink - both larger Orcs than Ugor - are keeping watch on the crenellations outside of the castle. Today is no different from any other day and Randigar and Serlink are both being complacent in their duties, very few souls even know of this place's existence, let alone will plan to attack it.

Ugor smashes his hammer down again with a thud, its resonant chime echoing through the chilled halls of the fortress. Randigar cracks a joke and Serlink laughs, a wolf's howl is heard in the distance.

Ugor raises his masterpiece infront of his beady eyes and examines his fine work, he is proud of the edge he has created and it should serve his Orc master well in combat. He dips it into a vat of water with a sharp hissing sound to quench the blade.

Serlink has said something to Randigar that he doesn't like and they start to fall out, they turn away from each other for a little while. As they have nothing better to do, they quickly reconsile and are back to poking fun at each other again.

The air outside begins to howl, it is not unusual for the wind to pick up from time to time up in the mountains, and doesn't cause any concern to inhabitant Orcs. With a sharp blow, the wind howls through into Ugor's room and blows out a few of his candles. He grunts and gets up reluctantly, he carefully relights his candles allowing him to see the room clearly again.

Ugor turns sharply.

He heard something...

Something big.

What sounded like a huge beast roaring in the distance, and almost what sounds like, flapping perhaps?

Randigar heard it too and tells Serlink to be quiet with a sharp hit to his chest. He freezes and points to the sky. Serlink tries to follow his stubby green finger to see where he is pointing, he sees what Randigar sees - heading straight towards them - and his eyes narrow...

## Session 01 - 27/02/2020
### Chapter 1
##### Harbin

The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly aligned with the neighboring Dwarves and Gnomes. Then an Orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.
 
In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.

The heroes are currently sat in the town green, reminiscing about their adventurers of past. Marlade, the Human Cleric is currently telling them all how great the god Savras is, but the other two do not seem interested at all. An Elf Bard, Sasha, is currently tuning her prized lute that she inherited from her noble family. The last member of this party, a hulking Goliath Barbarian named Minogar Threefury towers over them both, laughing at Marlade's futile attempts at conversion.

Harbin Wester, a sorry looking, podgy man is making his way as fast as his feeble body would allow him to shuffle towards the heroes. As he arrives, out of breath, he makes a shrewd comment about how they are "supposedly" adventurers and mentions how he only knows about them thanks to his townsfolk letting him know they are in the area.

He does have a quest to offer the group, however, and offers it forcefully, being too excitable to even wait for a response.

"Ah you must be the would-be adventurers I keep hearing the people gossip about, but I have need your help with an issue, and it must be kept hush-hush as it were" he exclaims with his posh dialect and an inflection of superiority.

"Well, you see, its the farmer's son, he has gone missing" he says with a slight frown which could be mistaken for genuine concern, but is really for his own image than that of the well being of the boy.

He mutters something to himself, forgetting that he is within earshot "Ever since that night when they came...". He realises quickly that he is not alone, "Oh, sorry! Where was I, ignore that, ahem!"

"Hes gone missing, yes, and I need you to search for the poor boy, he must<br/>
be so scared, out<br/>
there on his own,<br/>
poor thing, poor<br/>
thing. I would ask<br/>
around the town<br/>
if I were you,<br/>
surely<br/>
someone<br/>
knows<br/>
something about<br/>
where he would have<br/>
got too. I would do it<br/>
myself of course, but<br/>
you know, the old<br/>
gammy leg playing up<br/>
again HAHA, the old<br/>
leg you see"
\page

<img 
  src='http://i.imgur.com/hMna6G0.png' 
  style='position:absolute; bottom:50px; right:30px; width:380px' />

Harbin lifts up the bottom of his leg to show the party, it is grim. Sasha recoils slightly and wishes she hadn't looked.

Excitedly, he says "Thanks again, for doing this, just remember I will be in my house if you need me, do let me know when you have found him"

He pauses for a second and says "There will of course be, a reward" gesturing with his hands to indicate financial reward, but doesn't say how much.

Harbin retreats back to the Townmaster's hall as quickly as he came out, onto the next important task he has to do that day.


The group are left a little bewildered by that encounter, but decide to carry out his wishes and ask around town, they head over to the Stonehill Inn first.

> ##### Stonehill Inn
> The Stonehill Inn is the main Inn in Phandalin (but not the only one) it is a family ran business consisting of the Father, Toblen Stonehill, his wife Trilena, and their son Pip.
>
> Often, only the Parents are the ones running the Inn, as Pip is too young to be of much help, he is often found playing in the streets of Phandalin with his best friend Carp.

### Chapter 2
##### Lanar

Inside the Inn, the heroes are greeted with a warm atmosphere and a cosy decor. There is a man sitting alone nursing a pint and two men further into the Inn engaged in conversation, one of them looking like a knight.

Behind the bar are the two owners of the establishment, Toblen and his wife Trilena, looking at the heroes who have just entered.

Marlade immediately goes to sit with the drunk looking man, possibly due to his clerical nature in wanting to help the sick and down trodden. The other two head over to the bar and speak to Toblen.

Minogar walks up to the bar, hunching his back slightly to fit under the comparitively low ceiling, he begins talking to the barkeep - Toblen. He orders 5 ales and pays with a single gold piece. This slightly irks Toblen as he has to go the register and get lots of change out to give back to the goliath.

Sasha asks about the missing boy, Toblen and his wife mention that they didn't even realise the boy was missing.

The heroes tell the couple that the missing boy is the farmer's son but do not know his name.

"Ah, the farmer's boy is named Carp, he plays with our son Pip a lot. To be honest I haven't actually seen him for a couple of days, I never twigged that he had gone missing!" Trilena continues, "You should talk to our son Pip, he is out on the Town Green last I checked!"

The pair take their drinks and turn to sit with the knight and the farmer.

Meanwhile, Marlade is trying to talk to the drunk, but is not making much progress. The drunk is slurring his words and rocking back and forth. "A boy?", the drunk exclaims, "Missing in where you say?"

Marlade groans and continues his endeavour.

Sasha and Minogar have not been noticed by the Knight and Farmer who are talking between themselves, and so they interupt the Knight who is currently talking. He tries to ignore them initially and carry on his conversation, but the pair are persistent and he turns to them, "Do you mind? We are trying to have a conversation here, can you not find somewhere else to sit?".

They ask the knight who he is and what gives him the right to speak to them like that.

"I am a knight of Neverwinter", he says churlishly, "On official business by Lord Dagult Neverember, I am not about to disclose it to peasants such as yourselves. Now if you will excuse me."

He turns back to the farmer and continues his conversation. The adventurers try to instead appeal to the farmer and persuade him to begin a dialog. They ask him about the missing farmer's boy.

"Carp has gone missing?", he asks with a panic, "How long has he been gone?". The pair tell him two days, "Two days?! Wait. Are you sure? He can't have been missing that long. I saw him on the farm yesterday... I was helping him tend to the fields."

They tell him that they are sure he is missing, but he cannot aid them with any information other than what they already know. So they go and sit back with Marlade.

Marlade's patience had grown very thin with the drunken man by this point, however, and he grabs him by the scruf of his neck and leads him out of the Inn. The group follow in a hurry.

A seemingly possessed Marlade, looks around frantically on the doorstep of the inn. He asks the group if they know of any body of water nearby, but they do not. In the center of the town he notices a shrine with a lady kneeling infront of it.

Dragging the reluctant drunk over to the shrine, he notices something odd about the shrine.
\page

<img 
  src='https://i.imgur.com/rxxVJK3.png' 
  style='position:absolute; bottom:50px; left:30px; width:280px' />
  
> ##### Shrine of Luck
> In the centre of Phandalin is a small outdoor shrine in the shape of a female with her eyes closed. It is dedicated to the goddess Tymora - the goddess of luck - the shrine was built by an inhabitant of the town in order to make it easier to worship.

Angrily, Marlade quickly changes course when he realises the prayer bowl that the elf lady was using is not big enough for what he wants.

Confused, the other two follow him as he drags the poor drunk in the direction of Phandalin's farm.

At the farm, still possessed and quick tempered, Marlade comes up to a water trough - intended for the horses - and throws the drunk down.

Mercilessly, the cleric grabs the back of the drunkards scalp and forces him down into the water, the drunk begins to drown. Nearing his last breath, Marlade lifts his head back out of the water and asks him his name.

Due to this treacherous scenario the drunk finds himself in, he quickly sobers up. "Lanar!! My name is Lanar!!" he exclaims.

Again, the cleric dunks the hapless man, and the other two look on at this spectacle.

Marlade asks him repeatadly where the boy is hidden. Lanar begs the cleric "I do not know, I do not know".

But Marlade isn't satisfied, he knows that Lanar knows something... And will not stop until he knows it too.

This tortuous exercise continues for what seems like an eternity to Lanar, and eventually, he relents. "The boy! The boy! They have taken him into the cave! Please thats all i know!". Marlade asks him who has taken to the cave, "They will kill me if I tell you, I can't".

Back under the water Lanar goes, as Marlade shoves his head down once again. Upon surfacing Lanar trembles, 
<span style="margin-left: 110px">"Please! Please! Im telling you thats</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">all I know, these cultists in black robes</span>
<span style="margin-left: 130px">took him from the farm! They went</span>
<span style="margin-left: 120px">into a cave, but I was too scared to</span>
<span style="margin-left: 110px">follow! Please! I am but a coward!"</span>

<span style="margin-left: 90px">Marlade stops, feeling pity and a little</span>
<span style="margin-left: 200px">disgust for the poor</span>
<span style="margin-left: 210px">man. The group</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">decide to keep</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">Lanar with them</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">and head to the</span>
<span style="margin-left: 220px">cave, Lanar is</span>
<span style="margin-left: 240px">forced to lead</span>
<span style="margin-left: 250px">the way.</span>
```
```
### Chapter 3
##### Goblins

Lanar leads the group to the base of the woods south of the ruins of Tresendar Manor.
> ##### Tresendar Manor
> More of a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, and is completely open to the elements nowadays.

As they approach the woods, they see a campfire, reduced to embers. Huddled around this campfire, laughing and snickering, are three Goblins. They are far enough away not to have noticed the adventures, who ready their weapons for combat.

Sasha contemplates what to do for a second and decides to rush in and attack the nearest Goblin with all the might she could muster.

Unfortunately, being a humble bard her attack glances on the Goblin's armor causing no damage and angering it and his accomplices.

Seeing this, Minogar launches a javelin towards the Goblins but it lands short. Meanwhile, Marlade decides to start concentrating on a spell to buff his allies.

The Goblins immediately start wailing on the poor Bard, knocking her unconscious in seconds and one turns his attention to Minogar.

Sasha begins to fade away into the abyss, and Minogar rushes in - his blood boiling. Taking his mighty greataxe in both hands he brings it down hard on the nearest goblin, who is cleft in twain.

Marlade fires his crossbow from distance, and launches an arrow like a bullet straight into the eye of another Goblin, killing it instantly.

Sensing her time is short, Minogar drags Sasha back to the group and Marlade plants his shield in the dirt between her and the remaining Goblin. 

Lanar rushes in seeing Sasha's condition to stabalise her.

Sasha is still unconscious, but thanks to the other two's tremendous bravery, it looks like she might make it.

The remaining Goblin ponders for a second and sees his accomplices dead on the forest floor, he decides to turn tail and run away.

Still raging, Minogar charges through the forest javelin in hand and blood in his eyes for the fleeing Goblin. The Goblin manages to run about 10 feet before it lands right through his vital organs and pins him to the ground. The Goblin writhes for a few seconds, then becomes motionless.

Marlade is tending to Sasha's wounds with his medical kit and manages to just about stabilise her. She gets up slowly, still gravely wounded, but it looks like she has made it and is still alive. For now...

The group turn their attention towards the woods, how will they be press on now?

## Session 02 - 05/03/2020
### Chapter 4
##### Cave

The group decide to head towards the cave, but first they check the bodies of the goblins. One of the goblins has a pouch of gold, which the name "Jayon" written on it, presumably stolen. Another has a letter which reads:

<div class='descriptive'>
Giplin,
 
Take Jogtigs and Pymat and position yourself at the southern most point of Tresendar Woods, do not allow any intruders past this point, lest they find the entrance to our hideout.
 
I do not need to tell you that our operations would be in jeopardy if we were to be found out.
 
Once again, if you let me down once more, the punishment is death... So don't!
 
Iarno
</div>

Pondering the note, the group pause and look around for more threats, before realising that the letter is addressed to the goblins that they had killed.

Lanar leads the group through the woods north and they arrive at the mouth of the cave, Lanar complains that without a weapon he is defenseless. The group don't really want to arm their captive, but give him one of the goblin's schimitars to shut him up, the group light torches and peer inside.

A cold breeze fills the large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty foot high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm. There appears to be bones of some description to the east of the chasm, between the two bridges.

The group listen and can hear the faint sounds of torture and various magical effects.

Minogar bravely heads down a corridor to his left on his own, at the end of the corridor he sees two doors, one to his left leading south and one to his right to the north. He decides to listen at the southern door, but cannot hear anything on the other side.

He then walks over to the northern door, and listens again, inside this room he hears people shouting and what sounds like the same people playing a game involving dice - it sounds like they are merry and one of them has just lost a lot of money.

The rest of the group decide to head a bit further north back in the cave and head down another corridor, also heading left. This corridor also has two doors at the end of it, both pointing north and south. They use Sasha to send messages between themselves and deduce that the southern door for them may link to the door that Minogar is listening too.

The group listen to their door, the one pointing south, and also hear the game being played that Minogar could hear, but louder.

They decide that they should do a pincer movement and both sides prepare to burst through their respective doors with intent to kill whoever is inside.

Minogar bursts into the room and sees<br>
several worn tables and chairs scattered around<br>
this large room. Wooden benches are drawn<br>
up against walls decorated with<br>
draperies of brown and red, and<br>
several ale kegs are propped up and<br>
tapped. Four human figures wearing<br>
robes of purple and black are gathered<br>
around one of the tables. A stack of<br>
coins and trinkets is heaped upon the<br>
tabletop between them.

He throws a javelin at the<br>
closest figure and hits him in the<br>
neck, the human proceeds to bleed<br>
to death, Minogar also takes his axe<br>
and slices the head off another in<br>
a brutal display of barbaric rage.<br>
The unfortunate human's head<br>
rolls over to the other two cultists,<br>
who appear to be drunk and don't<br>
quite realise what is happening<br>
yet.

The rest of the group burst<br>
into the room and Marlade<br>
puts his crossbow point<br>
blank to back of the head<br>
of one of the remaining two cultists. He<br>
fires but it jams, and he instead whacks the human in the head with the butt of his crossbow.

Lanar lifts his schimitar high above his head and attempts to attack the remaining cultist, but can barely swing it and misses.

Sasha stabs the one that Marlade hit earlier with her longsword and kills him, she then throws a dagger at the other one and hits him right between the eyes, killing him instantly.

The group collect themselves and search the bodies, they hold nothing of value but the game they were playing sure does. It looks like the cultists were playing a game involving betting and there is a lot of money on the table, which the group take.

### Chapter 5
##### Consequences

After their resounding victory the group are feeling fearless and confident, they head to the door Minogar found to the south, and Sasha listens to it.

She recoils slightly and says she can hear a language being spoken that she cannot understand, and it sounds demonic.

Knowing Abyssal, Marlade puts his ear to the door and hears the following conversation between three people, which he translates to the group:

<div class='descriptive'>
Person 1: "Why did he capture that boy, he is going to expose the lot of us?"<br>
Person 2: "Silence, Ionar knows what he is doing, he obviously has plans for that retched scoundrel"<br>
Person 3: "Yeah, hopefully use him to clean up around here, this place is a mess, or at least sacrafice the insulent whelp, get some use out of him"<br>
Person 1: "But how can you trust Ionar when he couldn't even keep his old master alive?"<br>
Person 2: "Nezznar was weak and short sighted, we are much better serving under (unintelliagable demonic words), he will bring the dawn of a new age!"<br>
Person 1: "I hope you are right, for all our sakes..."
</div>

Marlade then kicks the door down, miraculously the inhabitants do not notice, he sees a barracks that contains four roughly built wooden bunks. In the centre of the room is a pile of skulls surrounded by dimly lit candles. Four humanoids in hooded cloaks are stood equal distance around the skulls, murmurring under their breath.

Marlade attacks the nearest one, and shoots a bolt at the back of his head, the cultists barely flinches as blood trickles down the back of his neck from the arrow, the cultist slowly turns around and Marlade sees his face, the stench of death fills the room and his horrifying visage is burned into Marlade's mind forever. The cultist's appearance is that of a corpse, his eyes milky white and his jaw dropped slightly on his dark grey wrinkled face, the purple magic eminating from the skull in the centre of the room spirals around the four cultists and almost appears to be propping them up.

The cultist lets out a demonic shout and fires purple lightning from his fingers, hitting Marlade. Marlade is raised up into the air and cannot move an inch.

Sasha then tries to come to Marlade's aid and throws a dagger at the cultist, hitting it in the eye and sticking there. The cultist just tips his head to the side and throws the same purple lightning at Sasha, she takes her longsword and deflects the blast but is knocked backwards.

Another cultists turns towards the elf and also casts the purple lightning, unfortunately, Sasha is not quick enough to deflect again and is suspended in the air, suffering the same fate as Marlade.

Minogar goes into the room and attacks, Lanar sees his oppurtunity and says "I told you they would kill me!" and runs back into the cave, abandoning the party.

The barbarian takes his axe and slams it into the cultist's torso with all his might, it gets lodged into it's torso and the cultist screams demonic noises and launches Minogar into the air with purple lightning. The whole party is now suspended in the air, paralyzed.

The cultist slowly removes all the weapons embedded into his body and throws them to the ground, he begins to speak common - laughing at the party. He hovers over to Marlade, "Your gods can't save you now, cleric!", his speech is gutterall and deep, otherworldly. With a thud he knocks out Marlade and releases him from the spell, the cleric lands in a heap on the floor, out cold.

The demonic cultist then turns to Sasha, "Aren't you a bit far from home, little elf?", and knocks her out same as Marlade. Finally he turns to Minogar, "Big and strong Goliath, where did that get you?", and knocks him out all the same.

All the group can see is blackness, the eternal void. They can hear something though...

They hear gnashing, scraping, the clanging of weapons and demonic screams, they hear sounds of slaughter but also the unmistakeable sound of dragon fire.

Marlade is awoken, not by his own accord but by the figure currently looming over him. As his vision focuses, he sees a Red Dragonborn clad in plate armor kneeling over him, "Are you OK friend?" the Dragonborn asks, his voice harsh but kind.

Marlade sits up and the Dragonborn goes over to Sasha, he places his hand on her chest and Marlade swears he can see his hand glow when he does this, Sasha slowly sits up, dazed and confused.

Finally, the Dragonborn goes to<br>
Minogar and helps him up, the group<br>
stand up and dust themselves down.<br>
They are still in the same room as the<br>
cultists, but it looks like they met their<br>
end, they are in pieces scattered<br>
around the room. The glowing skull<br>
from earlier is now faintly<br>
humming pink and there<br>
appears to be no more<br> magic in the air.

### Chapter 6
##### Urzal

The Dragonborn speaks to the party, "Hello, my name is Urzal, Urzal Desecrate - I am a Paladin of the Lord's Alliance. I have been following you since you left Phandalin, you see I have been tasked with finding the leader of these cultists - the Zhentarim - and bringing him to justice for his crimes in Neverwinter. My findings lead me to this hideout and I saw you taking on those Goblins earlier. I must say I was impressed how you handled them, especially you Goliath! It is a good job I was following you, you didn't stand a chance against these four, they were casting a Ritual of Undeath and were effectively immortal. I would advise you to exercise a little more caution when travelling around hideouts or dungeons you aren't familiar with!"

Urzal lets out a hearty laugh, the group decide to stick together with the Paladin, and head north past the other cultists they killed earlier and listen to the northen most door. Urzal hears bubbling coming from the room and is confused but says he feels like he can almost hear the sound of a small boy sobbing. The group exclaim that they are searching for a small boy, and Marlade goes to kick the door in.

Urzal rages and stops Marlade from lurching forward, "What are you doing?! We need to  be more stealthy in this place if we are to be successful! Tyr's sake, how did you get this far in this dungeon doing that?!". The Dragonborn turns back to the door and advises the group open it slowly and peer in, as they can't possibly know what is inside.

Sasha slowly pokes her head in, she sees a room that appears to be a wizard's workshop. There is a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes. In the corner of the room is a small cage, with a boy stuffed into it, barely fitting, he is looking down and hasn't noticed the party.

> ##### Urzal the barbarian - or is it paladin now?
> Urzal was a member of an adventuring party who five years ago set out to find the Lost Mine of Phandelver and recover the Forge of Spells before an evil drow mage named Nezznar could take it for himself.
> 
> Back then, he was a Barbarian and often consumed by rage, it appears that since then he has found strength in the light and has taken an oath to become a paladin, although he still carries his trusty two-handed axe named Carn, perhaps his old Barbaric tendencies haven't completely left him after all?

Marlade looks around the alchemy table and pockets some items he think may be of use in the future, Sasha goes over to the boy in the cage, but he is unresponsive with his head down.

She tries to open the cage but as soon as her hand touches the cage, it passes through as though it isn't there, she realises the cage is sealed with a spell, they will have to find the mage that cast it.

The group see a door to another room next to the cage, they start to listen to it, Marlade decides to back track through the dungeon and try and create a pincer situation again.

Minogar listens to the door and can hear two voices, but cannot totally make out what is being said, one is completely foreign to him, but one seems to sound like Lanar...

### Chapter 7
##### Found

As Marlade heads back into the original cave entrance he tries to cross a chasm in the cave using a rickety bridge, it feels very unstable as he crosses but he makes it to the other side, he then heads north into a store room.

This area is the north end of the large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails. 

Marlade takes some of the hammers for later and inspects the room, as it appears to be a dead end.

To his left however, he sees light peering through the wall in the shape of a door, it is a secret door made of stone!

The rest of the group are still listening to the other door, and decide to turn the handle to see if it is unlocked. The door is unlocked, but Sasha turning the handle alerts the occupants inside! "Who goes there?" one of them shouts.

With little options left, the group decide to just burst in and try to surprise the occupants. Inside they see a bedchamber walls of which are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed. Standing to their left is a short, dark-bearded human male in robes, he wears a princely mantle of ermine. A beautiful glass staff is in his hands and he is speaking to none other than Lanar.

Lanar's eyes narrow and thinks fast<br>
"Please save me heroes, this mage<br>
has me captive!".

Marlade meanwhile, tries to<br>
open the door he found, but is<br>
struggling to find the<br>
strength.

Urzal attacks the mage<br>
first, but the mage swiftly<br>
moves out of the way of<br>

Minogar then rages and follows up behind Urzal attacking the mage, he lands a decisive hit and the mage reels backwards.

Suddenly, Lanar gets enraged by this and starts to change...

His skin turns dark blue and his eyes become a solid orange, he begins to growl uncontrollably and attacks Minogar with claws. Minogar is able to endure the first swipe thanks to his rock hard endurance afforded to him from his Goliath ancestry, and moves out of the way of the second swipe.

Marlade is still struggling with the stone door, he curses as he can hear his friends engaged in combat inside.

### Chapter 8
##### Iarno

Urzal slashes at the monstrosity that was once Lanar and shouts "Doppelganger!!" as his axe slashes in the direction of the doppelganger, it lurches backwards and avoids the hit.

Minogar aids Urzal and lands a hit on the doppelganger, it lets out a scream and grabs Minogar and begins brutally slashing with it's claws.

With a thud, Minogar falls to the ground gravely wounded, and unconscious from blood loss. Urzal kneels down, Sasha sees his hand begin to glow as he places it on Minogar's chest. With renewed vigor, Minogar rises again.

Sasha tries to keep the mage busy while this is happening and attacks with her shortsword, mortally wounding him, the mage drops to his knees.

Minogar then swings his axe at the doppelganger once again, slicing his left arm clean off. Sasha follows up and stabs at it's other arm with her dagger, sticking it in it's bicep.

Marlade meanwhile, gets angry at not being able to budge the door and cries out for power from his chosen deity - Savras. Suddenly, he is granted immense strength and shatters the stone door to pieces, he expects to see group but 
<span style="margin-left: 160px">instead sees another stone</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">wall.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 160px">To his right leading down a</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">staircase, he sees another</span>
<span style="margin-left: 160px">stone door, he curses and</span>
<span style="margin-left: 170px">begins to open that one same</span>
<span style="margin-left: 175px">as before.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 175px">The doppelganger is now</span>
<span style="margin-left: 175px">foaming at the mouth and</span>
<span style="margin-left: 180px">lashes out at Minogar with</span>
<span style="margin-left: 185px"> his lone arm, his claws dig</span>
<span style="margin-left: 190px"> into the Goliath's flesh</span>
<span style="margin-left: 195px"> and Minogar lets out a </span>
<span style="margin-left: 200px">roar. Urzal places his</span>
<span style="margin-left: 210px"> hand on Minogar's</span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> shoulder and heals </span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> the damage, he nods</span>
<span style="margin-left: 205px"> at Minogar.</span>
```
```
Minogar nods back, and lifts his axe swiftly from the ground, striking the doppelganger, who staggers backwards. The doppelganger taunts the group using Lanar's voice "You wouldn't hurt poor Lanar, now would you? Think of all the fun we had!"

The barbarian roars loudly and brings the axe back down, severing the head from the body of the doppelganger, it's head rolls along the floor and the body remains still for a second, before slumping into a heap. The head says it's final words and mouths obscenities towards Minogar.

Marlade manages to open the second stone door, this one is much easier than the first, he bursts in and shoots the kneeling mage in the back. "Gah, I submit! I submit! Please don't kill me!" The mage shouts.

Marlade tells the mage to start talking and to say who he is.

"My names, Iarno, Iarno Glasstaff - I will tell you anything, please. As long you spare me, I will tell you, please!"

## Session 03 - 03/04/2020
### Chapter 9
##### Interrogation

The group begin to interogate the mage, Minogar says to start talking.

"What do you want to know?!", Iarno pleads.

Minogar asks the mage who he is working for.

"They call themselves the 'Zhentarim' they wanted a base of operations in Phandalin, so I obliged."

Minogar asks who the Zhentarim are.

"I do not truly know!", Iarno exclaims "They threatened me if I did not cooperate!"

Minogar asks where the Zhentarim are now. Iarno looks confused and says they are in this very hideout, "How have you not come across any before now?!"

Minogar asks if those cultists they met earlier with the skull are Zhentarim.

"They are the Zhentarim 'Undying', they use young boys to keep themselves alive using their lifeforce, if all you saw was a skull, they must have been using that poor soul for a while now..."

Minogar then grows tired of these questions and hits the mage in the face with his pommel. Urzal growls at Minogar and says they should keep him alive for questioning. The goliath moans about having to keep the mage alive and gets the mage to remove his robes. Iarno complies and drops his staff and robes to the floor and stands there in his boxers, shivering. Sasha plays her flute mockingly while the mage undresses.

Marlade shows no remorse and takes the glasstaff and robes for himself.

Minogar asks the mage if there are any Zhentarim left in the hideout. Iarno grows visibly annoyed and says "How can I possibly know that?!". He pauses for a moment and asks, "Well how many have you lot killed so far?".

Marlade ignores the mage's question and changes the subject, he asks if the doppelganger that was Lanar was created by the mage.

"No, he was given to me as an aide to do my bidding... I guess he won't be doing that anymore..."
\page

  style='position:absolute; top:50px; right:0px; width:280px' />
  
Marlade asks the mage why he is here, and why he would need the aid of the Zhentarim.

"Many years ago, I used to work for another. His name was Nezznar and he had great plans for this land. He set out to hunt for "the forge of spells" a long forgotten enchanted forge that could empower any weapon. Before he could find it however, a band of adventurers destroyed him, mercilessly... I seek to avenge him and bring him back from the eternal void...". The mage turns to the dragonborn and says, "I'm sure you know this story well... Urzal."

Urzal lowers his head and looks back up at the group, he explains that he was a part of that adventuring group and killed Nezznar, he explains that if Nezznar were to be resurrected, it would not be a good thing for the town.

Marlade turns to Urzal and asks what he plans to do with the mage.

"I will take him back to Neverwinter, to the Hall of Justice to stand before Lord Dagult Neverember for his crimes."

Sasha reminds the group about the boy, and asks the mage if he knows how to release him from the cage. Iarno explains that he is the one who locked the cage, and only he knows the incantation to release the boy.

Minogar notices a chest at the base of the bed in the room they are in, he goes over to it and opens it. Inside, he finds a load of gold and silver, aswell as silk pouch which contains jewels and a lustrious pearl. He investigates the chest further, and sees two parchments at the bottom. He takes them out and looks over them. Both are marked with a green wax seal that says "Property of Neverwinter", one is a scroll of charm person, the other is a scroll of fireball.

He tries to quickly pocket them, but Urzal asks what he has found. Minogar decides to be honest about what he has found, and shows them to the dragonborn. He does try to show it from far away to avoid the dragonborn seeing the mark, but Urzal asks to see them closer.

"Is that the mark of Lord Dagult?!" the dragonborn says, "Ordinarily I would take these back to Neverwinter, but I feel you may need these with time. I will allow you to keep them."

Minogar asks if this means they are stolen, and Urzal replies saying that they must be if this grubby mage managed to get his hands on them.

### Chapter 10
##### Rescue

Sasha, Minogar and Urzal decide to take Iarno forcefully back into the previous room and free the boy.

Minogar keeps Iarno restrained and Sasha gets Iarno to free the boy from his prison.

"If I free the boy, then I am of no use to you, how do I know you won't just kill me when my use to you has expired?"

Urzal says that his fate will only be decided by Lord Neverember, and he swears they will not harm the mage as long as he is cooperative.

Minogar also says to the mage that he has little options, and to just get on with it. Sasha threatens the mage with her sword, and Iarno goes up to the cage. He touches the cage and it falls away into nothingness. The boy in the cage, still unresponsive falls backwards onto the cold floor.

Sasha runs over and checks the boy. She deduces that he is alive, but not responding to any external stimuli. Urzal says that he believes it is important to get this boy to safety as quick as possible.

Minogar asks Urzal to try to heal the boy, Urzal goes up to the boy and places his scaly hand on his chest, but quickly withdraws it back. "This seems to be more than just a simple spell..." Urzal says, he looks extremely concerned.

The goliath turns to Iarno and demands to know what is wrong with the boy. "I, I don't know! The Zhentarim cast the spell on him, I only locked him away! I swear!"

Minogar asks the mage if the Zhentarim are doing to the boy what they were doing to the skull in the other room. "I don't believe so," Iarno explains "So far, I have only observed them practicing undeath magic on those recently deceased, as this boy is alive, they can't be as far as I know!"

Urzal now restrains Iarno as Minogar carries the boy, the group rush out of the dungeon as fast as they can.

### Chapter 11
##### Outside

Meanwhile, Mirazumin, an Elf Ranger is being accompanied by one of the town's guards, Marcus. They have also been asked by the Townmaster - Harbin Wester - to search for the missing boy. Their search has also lead them to the cave entrance, just as the other group come rushing outside.

Minogar sees them approaching and asks what they are doing here, he asks if they are with the enemy. Mira says that he is not associated with this mage at all, and explains that the townmaster asked them to come. Mira turns to the dragonborn and speaks his name, recognising him.

Urzal puts down the mage and laughs, "Mira! Long time no see!". Minogar turns to Urzal and asks if he knows this elf, "Yes, very well!" Urzal says "He helped us to defeat Nezznar back in the day!".

"I knew I recognised you, pitiful elf," Iarno fumes.

Mira says to Urzal that he always used to try and kill his pet, and still hasn't forgiven him for that one.

\page

  
Urzal approaches Mira's panther - Misty - and pats it's head, giving Mira a wink, "Ah, it was all in good fun" and chuckles to himself.

Minogar notices that during this exchange, another figure has been approaching the group - from a distance it looks like it is in fully clad armour.

The goliath shouts out to the figure to identify itself, and as the figure walks closer they see that it is indeed a knight, and is none other than Justice Keenseeker, the knight they met in the inn earlier.

"Hail heroes, it is I, Justice Keenseeker, I see you have found the missing boy!" Justice laughs, "Urzal, I knew I could count on you!"

"Thank you sir," Urzal bows whilst Minogar sighs and rolls his eyes.

Sasha complains to the knight that she feels the group are missing out on a little credit here.

"Of course, where are my manners!" as Justice hands a note to Minogar, who proceeds to read it in a silly voice and annoys Justice. Minogar says it is revenge for him not letting him finish his pint.

<div class='descriptive'>
Lord Dagult,
 
I believe I may have solved your "Thundertree" issue.
 
These adventurers have displayed great bravery in the town of Phandalin and I have sent them to your city for you to meet them for yourselves.
 
Signed, Sir Justice Keenseeker
</div>

"It is a knight's commendation," Justice continues "If you ever find yourselves visiting the great city of Neverwinter, show this to one of the guards and they will take you straight to Lord Dagult, as you have shown great bravery on this day, I believe you are the ones who can help him..."

Sasha pipes up after inspecting the boys condition and warns the group that he still needs to be seen to.

Urzal and Justice advise the group to take the boy back into town to his mother, they proceed to take Iarno away and head back to Neverwinter.

Marlade goes up to the boy and tries to see what magic has affected the boy, he believes the boy has been cursed in some way and that a potion of healing may help.

Sadly, the group do not possess a single one.

Sasha turns to Marcus and asks who he is.

He looks annoyed and says he is the person here to do a job that the group do not seem to have done properly, he also scolds the group for the way they spoke to the knight earlier. He is at least impressed that the boy is still alive at least.

Marlade again tries to heal the boy, but it appears to make his condition worse, Marcus shouts at Marlade saying the machinations of his spell are not doing the boy any good.

Minogar comes in and asks what does Marcus suggest them to do, and Marcus shrugs but says that they need to act quickly, whatever they decide to do. Minogar goes over and picks up the boy, as Sasha is growing weary and the group head back into Phandalin in the direction of the farm.
```
```
### Chapter 12
##### Qelline

The group arrive back at Alderleaf farm and see the familiar cottage with its red roof, smoke slowly seeping out the chimney. However, the curtains are all drawn and when they try the door they discover it is locked.

Minogar knocks loudly on the wooden frame, shouting that they have the boy and to let them in.

"I don't believe you, go away", a small raspy old ladylike voice cries out from inside. "I've lost my boy, let me grieve in peace."

Sasha goes up to the door and tries to persuade the old woman to let them inside, her kind words resonate with the old woman and she decides to open the door slowly.

As the door opens, Sasha sees nothing before her, confused, she then looks down and sees a small halfling woman standing there with tears down her face. Sasha turns to allow the woman to see Minogar carrying the boy and explains that while they have saved the boy, he is still very unwell.

The group ask who she is, "I am Qelline, Qelline Alderleaf, I am this boy's mother and I run the Alderleaf farm!"

The little woman is initially excited to see her boy once more, but quickly returns to being solemn once realising the state he is in. Sasha asks if the woman has any potions of healing that they could try, and she leaps into action and starts looking around her house for any potions.

She comes back to the group with her head hanging, saying she thought she had some, but alas has none left. "I know!" she shouts, "You could visit Barthen in town, he normally sells potions and what-not!"

The group decide to leave the boy with his mother and head over to Barthen's Provisions.

### Chapter 13
##### Barthens

Arriving outside they see a rather large building, Barthen's is the biggest tradepost in Phandalin . It's shelfs stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown.

With door being left ajar, the group head inside and see a bald man with a small white beard behind the counter, it is Elmar Barthen, the shopkeeper, he greets them with a hearty hello.

He recognises Marcus and asks how the town guard is doing. Marcus says things could be better but still good, he tells Elmar. He also lets Elmar know they have found the missing boy, but that he appears to be cursed.

\page

  style='position: absolute; bottom: 50px; right: 0' />
Minogar asks Elmar to help the group, "I don't how I could be of help im afraid, I know very little about curses," Elmar explains.

Sasha says he can help by selling them a potion of healing, "Ah, yes... well normally I would... but you see... my shipment hasn't arrived. And to be honest, it hasn't arrived for a while now. Normally I get a shipment say, once a week from an old lady who brews them just south of the town at Umbrage hill. But no-one has heard from her for weeks."

The group seem bewildered that an old woman has not been heard from for a while and no-one has done anything about it, but decide to head south to get some potions!

### Chapter 14
##### Umbrage

Built on the slope of Umbrage Hill is an old stone windmill surrounded by an iron fence. A large winged monster with a spiky tail is trying to knock down the windmill’s front door. A woman appears in a second-floor window, waves at the group, and yells, “A little help?!”

The group stand well back, the beast has not spotted them yet. Minogar turns to Mira and asks if she knows what it is. He recognises it as a Manticore, a ferocious beast that is strange to be spotted so close to a human settlement, he explains that some are known to speak common and that if they were to attack it chances are it would not end well for them.

<div class="descriptive">
“Manticores love the taste of human flesh. That’s why, on trips through the mountains, I always travel with human guards.”

— Marthok Uldarr, dwarf copper merchant
</div>

Marlade nudges Sasha and says she should be the one to talk to the Manticore. The group all move forward and shove Sasha ahead slightly. The manticore stops attacking the door and slowly turns to the group.

The manticore begins to step towards the group and Marcus shouts asking it to leave the door alone. It explains that it needs food and is starving, normally he would just hunt around it's normal habitat but it has been kicked out.

It explains further, that a white dragon came into his lair and made it flee, this is the only piece of food it has found for days.

"I am not a piece of food!" the old woman shouts.

Sasha pleads with the manticore to leave the woman alone and find food somewhere else, "I regret to have to do this, but it is the natural way" the manticore says.

Minogar thinks quickly, he tells the manticore that there are some recently dead goblins near a cave in Phandalin, why not head there?

Slowly, the manticore approaches the goliath. By comparison the goliath - who is usually towering - is made to look quite meek in the manticore's presence. Minogar sees the beast's almost human face as it comes so close as to feel its warm breath on his face. The beast slowly smiles revealing razor sharp teeth of multiple rows.
```
```
Whoosh! The manticore quickly darts to it's right and launches into the air, it's monstrous wings carrying it off into the distance. Minogar unclenches and relaxes. Marcus states to the group the power of asking nicely, as they head inside the windmill to meet the old woman.

Inside, the old woman introduces herself as Adabra, and thanks the group for saving her and says the group can have a reward. The group ask her to help the boy from earlier and that they need a potion of healing from her.

She hobbles over to her desk and opens a drawer, she pulls out six potions and hands one to each member of the party, she gives Sasha a second one,  "For the boy." she says. The group thank the old woman and quickly head back to town.

When they return to the farmhouse, they see that Harbin Wester - the Townmaster - is now also there, looking concerned at the boy. He thanks the heroes for their deeds as Sasha offers the potion to Qelline, the halfling takes the potion and thanks the Elf Bard. She sheepishly offers it to the boy and tips it into his mouth.

The group wait.

And wait.

And wait.

Sadly, nothing appears to happen, the boy remains still.

Harbin pipes up, saying he believes he knows of two potential ways to fix this problem. He explains they could either seek the inventive help of the Gnomes to the south in Gnomengarde, about a days journey or head further north for about five days to Thundertree and seek out an old druid by the name of Reidoth.

The group ponder for a moment and decide to try enlisting the help of the gnomes first, in the hopes they have an invention to remove the curse.

### Chapter 15
##### Gnomengarde

As the group head out of town and south they follow a stream uphill to the base of a mountain, where waterfall erosion has carved out a natural concavity. The roaring waterfall creates a cloud of mist as it plunges into a shallow pool of water, within which rise two small islands covered with two-foot-tall red, green, and purple mushrooms. Several cave openings overlook the pool from rocky ledges twenty to thirty feet above. The mountain blocks any sunlight from reaching this place.

Choosing the eastern most entrance, the group enter into the dwelling. The corridors are dank and Minogar has to slouch slightly to accomodate his large frame. The group turn the first corner they reach to the right.

"WHAM!" the group are scattered as something BIG hits them all and throws them every which way. Stunned the group see a massive behemoth of a tank, complete with four crossbows that has just fired a huge bolt in their direction. A gnome is seen on top piloting the mech, shouting something about destroying a monster, visibly insane.

Quickly, the group rank up and begin to take out each crossbow bolt, working together as best they can. After destroying the first crossbow, Marlade swings at another crossbow, but drops his mace. Fortunately as he goes to pick it up, the crossbow fires and narrowly misses the cleric as he bends over. Marlade realises what has just happened and thanks Savras - his chosen deity.

The group continue to dismantle the machine,

Mira swoops in and attacks the final crossbow slashing it with her two swords, and the machine falls apart.

In the rubble, a female rock gnome is visible, she is currently dazed. Minogar goes over and lifts her up, asking what that was all about.

The gnome gives Minogar a surly look and explains that a few gnomes have mysteriously disappeared recently and it has made her super jumpy. She explains that to her, five unknown large figures just burst into her workshop so she felt she needed to defend herself.

Minogar asks where the leader of the gnomes is. The gnome explains that the king has locked himself away in his quarters since the disappearances started happening, reports from other gnomes say he has gone mad. He asks the gnome what her name is, "Facktore" she replies. Minogar laughs at the name and the gnome grows visibly upset.

The group ask her to lead them to the king, but she refuses, explaining that she needs to carry on with her inventions and that she now suddenly has a lot more work to do now that her mech has been so kindly destroyed.

She at least gives the group directions to the king, explaining that the easiest way is as follows; "Head south, then west, across the bridge, keep heading west - oh, and beware the fans - and the throne room is the western most point of Gnomengarde"

Minogar releases the gnome, but places her on a high shelf so she cant get down.

The group decide now would be a good time to rest, and set up camp in the workshop. Sasha plays the song of rest and the group go to sleep.
