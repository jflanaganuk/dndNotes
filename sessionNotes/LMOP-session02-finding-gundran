The group arrive in Phandalin with the caravan
They go to barthen's provisions
Without gundran, elmar doesnt want to take the caravan as he doesnt know who these people are
The group try to get elmar to take the goods anyway, but he wont
harry is suspicious of elmar, but believes him
The group leave the caravan with elmar and head back to try and find the dwarf
Dwayne complains that they have to go back
The group find the caravan from before and approach
Bal looks and sees dried blood on the caravan,
Harry tries to look and trips and acts like it didnt happen
Dwayne easily sees the blood trail heading south into the woods
The group follow it and arrive at the entrance to a cave with a stream running out of it
As they approach the cave, they see 2 goblins on the other side of the stream near some trees
Dwayne tries to sneak up one of them, he gets behind one but Bal follows him and alerts them
The goblins begin to attack and dwayne stabs the closest one in the shoulder
Bal hits the other one with her sword
The two goblins gang up on dwayne and knock him unconscious
The group decide to leave him for dead and focus on killing the goblins
Harry kills one with a javelin throw and grabs the other
He takes it over to the stream after trying to get it to talk
The goblin is submerged and simply drowns.
A letter falls out of his pocket...
