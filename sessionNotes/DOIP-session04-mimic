the group start in the makeshift camp, sasha complains about being in the water
the group decide to enter where they were before. in pursuit of the invention
they enter the crossbow room again, and see the rubble from before, but dont see facktore
minogar checks the shelf and sees a shoe
minogar ponders, he looks around the room trying to find the gnome. he heads over to a worktable to see if she is hiding underneath.
she is not and he sees plans on the table, but cannot read them
he asks the group if anyone can read gnomish, the group do not
sasha grabs the shoe and has a closer look
she looks inside and notices the shoe is a bit wet, saliva
minogar realises she has been eaten
references something eating the gnomes and believes they took her only defence away
the group head south and come to a junction where they can go east or south
they head south and see two gnome guards

stop who goes there, two gnomes are pointing crossbows at the group
minogar tries to reassure the gnomes they are friendly
the gnomes ask if the group are shapechangers, they have been tasked with killing them on sight
the other gnome gets annoyed that the gnome told them what they are supposed to be doing
prove you are who you say you are
minogar says they killed a shapechanger infact not too long ago
the gnomes seem perplexed that the group have killed one before
they ask what the shapechanger looked like
minogar describes the doppelganger
the gnomes ponder whether they believe this tale, and decide to believe the group - XP for harry
the gnomes believe the group can help them
minogar explains that he used to be one of their best friends, and it stabbed them in the back
he'll never forget that day
marlade laughs
the gnome tries to relate, saying they act like your closest friend and next you know - youre being gobbled up
the gnome explains that the king has hidden himself away since the gnomes started going missing, they say there were 22 gnomes and the last head count revealed 20, the ask the group for aide
minogar asks what is trying to attack them
the gnomes explain that they havent actually seen whatever it is, as anyone who seems to come across it goes missing
mira asks then why are you after shapechangers
the gnomes explain that they believe thats their best guess as no one has seen a monster yet
the gnomes ask if the group have seen anything suspicious
the group look at each other and arent sure what to say
the gnome says that she notices they came from facktores place, and asks if she is well
minogar then asks them if infact they have seen facktore recently
the gnomes say it was roughly an hour ago that she last came past, muttering something about having to build her latest invention again
minogar thinks, then just says nevermind
the gnomes ask again, so wait, have you spoken to facktore.
the group lie and say they havent
mira says they really do need to talk to their king though
the gnomes say "ah yes, the king, he has locked himself away in his room"
they offer directions and say they might have a chance knocking on his door and talking through it
they start to gie directions but realise that a gnome will have to go with them to disable a trap
pog is ordered to accompany the group
mira quickly whispers to the group out of earshot of the gnomes, that shouldnt they tell them that facktore is dead, as they are about to be found out
minogar thinks that she cant have disappeared if they saw her an hour ago
mira makes the point that she could have been eaten less than an hour ago though
minogar ponders how long they rested for, and marlade also agrees she could have been recently snatched
minogar decides to address the female gnome again, he says that infact tehy might actually have recently passed a room, he tries to say that it already had a load of broken crossbows that were totally already there,
the gnome goes, yes thats facktore! so you have met facktore
minogar then says oh, that facktore, yeah we actually have met her actually, whoops
and the funny thing is, we found her shoe with saliva all over it
ulla says to pog to go and look at facktores room, pog is scared and asks the group if they would accompany him
the group agrees and goes back into facktores room
pog sees the shoe on the shelf and begins reaching up to try and grab it
the group awkwardly stand there as they dont want to embarass the gnome
eventually, the gnome asks the goliath to pass the shoe
minogar slowly lowers the shoe to the gnome, toying with him
pog sees the shoe, and says its definitely facktores, he pleads with the group that they are dropping like flies
mira says there are some notes on the table that they couldnt read that in gnomish, could he take a look?
he takes a look, he says there is a swear word in big letters, "rotate this", "shove that in there""and a q question mark"
the group deduce that the monster must be north, as the guards would have surely seen it
minogar asks the gnome what is north of their current position
pog says there is a dining room, a kitchen and a place where they store battle crabs
he says there is lots of gnomes in the kitchens at this time of day
mira asks the gnome to lead them to the kitchen
they pass through the dining room first, pog explains that normally the gnomes would eat in here but it is too early for there to be anyone here
he takes them firther north to a closed door, and says it is the kitchen, he advises them to knock first as the kitchen is usually very busy

marlade asks him to in first, but pog is shy and says he doesnt want to be told off by the kitchen staff "panana"
minogar says stand back ill kick it down, mira persuades him to just knock first
minogar relents and decides to just knock
he hears a female voice on the other side, "who is it" angrily
minogar says they are friends of facktore.
"facktore, what does facktore want?"
minogar explains that she thinks she gone missing
"oh, for gods sake we a re super busy in the kitchen, we have like 20 mouths to feed"
minogar says they wont be long, just gonna poke their heads in
"turvaaround, come and talk to these"
another voice is heard,
"ugh, hello?"
minogar says they have lost another one of their friends we need to see if facktore is in here
"facktore, not again, shes not in here, shes always causing trouble"
mingar says shes possibly dead
"shes dead?, hey panana, apparently, facktores died..."
"facktore?, facktore has, died? oh, look how much of a crap i give, get back on with the cooking!!"
"anyway, unless you have ingredients or you are gonna help us cook, we arent interested"
mira says they just want to take a look, we arent going to bother
the voice whispers slightly. "hmm, but panana will go mad if i let you in"
mira says who is panana
"panana, the boss, the woman you were just speaking too"
minogar mocks the name
the voice now seems to be talking back into the room "im trying to get rid of them, they wont go!"
marlade says to minogar that maybe he had the right plan all along
minogar says right, im busting the door down
minogar goes to push the door, and the gnome on the other end actually puts up a good fight but
the goliath is stronger and he bashes the door in, sending the gnome flying backwards into another gnome in the room
minogar feels a bit bad for shoving the poor gnome
minogar says, they only want to have a look and they wont be long
- describe room
minogar goes over and helps up the gnome and gives her a silver coin
"what was that for?"
minogar apoligises and says they just need to find facktore
"shes not in here, you just said you spoke to her and you think shes dead? what? why would she be in here!!"
"i know goliaths are the brightest, but for gods sake!" - swap with deity
minogar gets annoyed
marlade puts his hand on minogars shoulder, remember there is a body of water nearby, if we need it and winks
minogar looks at the staff in the kitchen he inspects panana closely and deduces that she appears to be infact a gnome
panana calms down and levels with the group. she advises them to seek out the two inventors fibblestib and dabbledob, as they are the smartest gnomes in gnomengarde
the group immediately start laughing at the names
panana explains that gnomish names can seem funny to humans but they are to be respected
she says to pog, seeing as he appears to now be with this group, why not show them to the inventors workshop
the group thank panana, and marlade heads into the back of the kitchen to the pantry
he sees crates full of different foods, but decides now is the not quite the time to steal from these gnomes
marlade says maybe later we'll steal from the gnomes
 pog asks what he said just then
marlade says maybe later we'll eat something
pog says well you can eat all the rewards you want, if you help us out
pog says he cant guarantee the king will reawrd but he will do him damndest to convince, and the king is normally kind
marlade says they will just take pog if not
pog smiles and says it is forbidden for gnomes to leave gnomengarde
the group head back south, pog is leading them to the inventors workshop
on the way, this time they head through the battle crab room

- describe room
marlade asks pog if the room is dangerous
pog explains that facktore made these as defence incase they are attacked, they are harmless while no one is inside it
marlade asks if they are likely to go off, pog assures him that they are safe and to be honest, none of them are really small enough to pilot them.
marlade asks if there is a threat going off right now, why arent they being used
pog says that outside they are no problem and good for defence, but inside, its really hard to turn them around in the narrow corridors
 pog goes on to mention that he believes that facktore was making a better one with crossbows, and offers to show the group it.
marlade interupts and says actually i hear its not that good.
sasha investigates one of the battle crabs
- describe the crabs
the group decide to leave the crabs and continue heading south back to where pog originally was
as they pass through facktores room, minogar makes a joke that facktore should really tidy up the place
 pog rushes ahead, and they hear him shouting "ulla, ulla! where have you gone!"
pog rushes to where she once stood and breaks down sobbing
the group inspect the ground for any clues but cannot find any
sasha stares intently at the closest torch on the wall
minogar tries to console pog, but he comes across insincere
mira just says can we go to the inventors workshop
pog says that they were given an order to always have a guard here, so now he must take over
minogaur picks pog up like a baby and pats his back saying there there itll be ok
"hmm, youre very warm, goliath"
minogar gets a bit disgusted and wuickly puts him down and walks away
pog sits there and pouts
marlade tries to find clues on the floor and gets too close and pokes his eye slightly on a rock
 pog at least offers directions and says to cross the bridge to the west, he warns that there is a trap that they have set. then realises that isnt gonna help, so instead tells them to go across the water into the north westernmost ledge and sneak into that room (as the gnomes sleep in there)
and then head south, fibblestib and dabbledob will be in there, they can show them to the king
as the group begin to follow these directions, ulla comes walking in and pog looks like he has seen a ghost
pog says "ulla youre alive?!"
"yes im alive, whats the problem"
"we thought you were dead"
sasha says that i thought ulla would have been watching this spot, she explains that she only went out quickly to relieve herself
sasha says pog thought you were dead and that he is in tears
"oh he is so dramtic isnt he, im surprised youve kept him with you this long, hes so annoying!"
"pog, show them to the kings chambers or whatever you were doing, let me get back up there"
mira and marlade both look closely at ulla, but she seems normal.
 pog offers to take the group past the fan trap now, and to the inventors

-describe the bridge
"follow me" pog says
the group are unsure and cross the perilous rope bridge - describe - all make it
they all chant minogar when its his turn who goes last
pog jokes that he has actually gone the wrong way
in the next room
- describe fans room
pog runs under the fans and flicks a switch round the corner, they turn off
he beckons them to follow
they cross the fans and get him to turn it back on, just in case
minogar points at the fans and says "facktore?" to pog
"did he make these"
pog explains that these were actually made by fibblestib and dabbledob
minogar says oh the great FS and DD i keep hearing about
pog says infact they are just through here and brings them into the inventors workshop
- describe workshop
pog translates their conversation to the group
they ask the group in common which invention is better
the group decides to straitjacket
they high five, the gnome has to jump
minogar asks what the hell they are actually talking about
fibblestib explains the situation with the king and the need to cure him
they explain that while they do argue, it produces better inventions with two minds
sasha asks them if they have seen facktore recently
they say they think they saw her a few days ago, but say they dont go over that side often as facktore has a screw loose
are you looking for her, we can show you where she is
sasha says well we suspect she has gone missing
not another one, they exclaim
they say to them, the kings condition is priority at the moment
minogar asks where the king currenty is
he is locked in his room
the gnome says he is so dramatic, but then realises what he has said and asks the group not to tell him he said that
sasha says they wont tell him, and asks why he is being dramatic
the gnome says the king has heard of these gnomes going missing and they believe he has locked himself away fearing for his own life
sasha asks if they could arrange a way for them to speak to him
they advise the group to just knock on his door, he is speaking, but isnt making much sense
they asks where the king is, pog offers to guide them
marlade realises that these could be the inventors the townmaster was on about, he whispers to the group and minogar says why not ask them?
sasha says before they go to see the king, sasha brings up the cursed boy and asks if they know a way to cure him
the inventors ask them to describe the curse
marlade says they tried to heal the boy and it seemed to do more damage
the gnomes whisper amongst themselves and say "have you tried, a potion of healing" looking all proud
the group say yes it doesnt work
the gnomes look dejected, and talk amongst themselves again, they think they know what it could be and think they can make an invention to solve it, but they have never tried.
they are interested to see if it would work though
the gnomes say they will help the party, after they have helped them with  their king

pog leads them to the kings chambers, to a locked door barricaded shut
the group bicker about whether to kick the door down or just knock
mira wants to knock, marlade and minogar want to just grab the king and drag him to the inventors
minogar asks if anyone wants to do anything before he destroys the door
pog pleads with them not to do that, as he will get in trouble
minogar says to just wear a fake mustache and kicks the door
pog runs off
before minogar can kick the door however, mira insists they just knock
mira knocks and hears a strange voice on the other side "whooo iss siittt???"
mira says they are here to save you
"my fwends have come to savvvee me have theyyy"
"nice try! im not opening the door"
"im gonna keep my gnerkli safe with me"
mira says they are just trying to help
"i bet you are, i bet you are trying to help me be consuummmeeddd"
mira starts getting annoyed and asks why would you lock yourself away while the gnomes die
"its the only to be safe"
"its the only to be safe"
mira says she understands but they are trying to help
"SHUSH GNERKLI, they cant HEAR YOU" the voice shouts
"lock myself away, its the only way to be safe"
"lock myself away, its the only way to be safe"
they also hear another voice who sounds like hes been gagged
mira says to minogar, ok kick the door down
sasha mentions have they even checked if the door is locked
its locked
the group steps back and minogar kicks
sasha plays her flute and inspires minogar
the voice on the other side says "muusssiccc i hear muuuusssiiicccc"
minogar is not successful and the door barely moves, he reels in pain slightly as it does damage
marlade decides now is the time for him to step up
he also hurts himself kicking it
minogar decides to just knock again
"knocking! knocking! why is it always the knocking!"
minogar professes his love to the king infront of everyone
he says he has lots of trinket and things for the king
he says i hope you can return my love as he runs his fingers along the door
there is no response
minogar sighs and levels with king, saying he knows about the shapechanger, and that they have killed these before and are genuinely here to help
minogar listens to the door and can hear that the king has moved away from the door and is still mumbling incoherent nonsense and hasnt even been listening
the group decide to head back to the inventors
on the way they see a door they havent checked yet
they go through and are now on a ledge above the inventors
there is a pedestal with a book on it
the title is written in gnomish, but underneath says in common "magick of gnomengarde"
minogar reads the spells and tries to take the book, but it is rigged to explode and is flung back into the group
the group go back to the inventors room
"ah, did you speak to the king?"
they mention that pog ran through in tears
minogar says ah dont worry about pog, hes always crying, if you see him with a mustache send him our way
he also mentions they didnt have much luck with the king
the gnomes explain they did try to warn them he had gone insane
the group say they could also hear another person inside they think
the gnomes explain that that is gnerkli, the other king, korboz has tied him up to keep him safe they reckon
mira asks if they have any explosive
the gnomes say facktore is best to ask about that, she can make weapons
mira explains they cant as she has gone missing
the gnomes say their inventions are wonderous but strictly non militant, facktore was the one in charge of that
their inventions are superior and more sophisticated
minogar takes the mick and says they were on about a straight jacket earlier
he asks if they have seen anything of this monster themselves
they think and say that the people who went missing used to work in the stock room with all the barrels
round the corner from facktores workshop
mira asks when this all started
about tenday ago
the group decide to head back and find the barrel room

they enter the fan room and flick the switch to turn it off
they proceed through and sasha uses mage hand to switch it back on when they are across
she carefully brings the hand back, but it fizzles away as soon as it returns
they arrive at the bridge again and minogar just bolts across
the rest of the group walk across normally
marlade is last to cross and thinks of lanar as he crosses safely
the group come across the guards ulla - back with pog
"any luck?"
the group explain that they think they know where the monster is and continue on
they see the barrel room in a corridor to the right
- describe room
the group decide to start checking the barrels,
mira checks the one in the far corner and taps it with her hand
suddenly the barrel begins to morph and a purple tendril tries to grab her, she recoils and manages to dodge it
she attacks it with her swords, she misses flailing in panic
the mimic again tries to grab her and succeeds, grappling him and squeezing hard
minogar rushes in with his greataxe, but slips on his other foot as he swings and lands on the floor, he hits another barrel and some wine goes in his mouth
marlade fires his crossbow at the mimic and hits it in one of its eyes
he also casts toll the dead which plays a bell and the mimic wriths in pain
sasha moves closer and throws her dagger at the monster but it misses and tings the back off the wall
sasha decides to play her flute to mira to boost her
mira attacks with her sword again and makes contact this time with both swords, the monster screams but holds on
it then attacks mira with a bite, but she pulls back to avoid it
minogar picks himself up, he drinks a bit of the wine for a confidence boost, he swings his greataxe again and hits it its barrelly centre
the monster screams and is looking bloodied
marlade uses guiding bolt dealing lots of damage and dazing the creature
the creature releases mira and speaks in common "stttoppp please"
the group lower their weapons
sasha uses blade ward to raise her defence just in case
mira asks who the mimic is, and if he know what is happening to the gnomes
the mimic licks its lips and says "of course i do, theyre delicious, very delicious"
mira says ah so you are eating them
"initially they were tough, and not much meat, but now ive aquired a taste for them"
mira says but why gnomes?
"normally i wouldnt eat gnomes, but ive been forced to relocate as it were"
who sent you mira asks
"nobody sent me here, ive been driven out, by that darn dragon"
"i hid in this cave as it flew around, and this little gnome came in looking for wine, so i hid, and he tapped me on my barrel top and i consumed him"
how many gnomes have you eaten mira asks
"i think about 3 so far, there was another one looking for his friend and an inventor that was stuck on a shelf, easy pickings i say!"
what would you normally eat besides gnomes
"normally adventurers like you" it smiles
minogar asks why should we keep you alive you got 10 seconds
"if you let me live, i swear, i wont return to this place"
mira and minogar both look at each other as if to say neither believe a word he is saying
minogar says you are gonna have to do better than that
the mimic realises he has no choice and begins to fight to the death
he lunges at mira
mira slashes with her sword in reaction and delivers the killing blow, the mimic screams out in agony and begins to melt and becomes a puddle on the floor which seeps and leaves a mark on the floor
minogar inspects the puddle and sees a small gnome skull, presumably belonging to facktore, he takes it
they decide to go and prove to the king its now safe

they pass the guards "i heard a lot of commotion, are you guys alright?"
minogar says they found the monster, turns out a mimic has been eating all the gnomes
"where was it"
it was a barrel in the storeroom
"of course, pog, it was in the storeroom! thats where they both worked, the ones who went missing, the both worked in the storeroom!"
minogar says now they need to speak to the king
mira says they have a skull but are unsure if they can prove it
the guards tell the group about a hidden passage in the throne room, if they look at the rear wall behind the throne it takes them to the kings chambers
the group cross the bridge once again, and see the fans. sasha casts mage hand again. the spell works and produces her hand, but the group see that has now sprouted butterfly wings.
sasha flaps them slowly, confused
she sends the mage hand through and disables the fans and the group head into the inventors room
they see fibblestib and dabbledob, who ask how it went
they then realise and start laughing at sasha's wings
"you must have cast a spell in gnomengarde, didnt you!"
sasha asks if they like her wings
they explain the wild magic of gnomengarde
sasha says they found facktore, but not in the way i wanted too
minogar shows them the skull
the gnomes ask if they did that,
the group say no and explain the mimic
the gnomes realise that that will be why the king doesnt trust anyone, as the mimic could have been anyone or anything
the gnomes tell the group how to get to the throne room
they arrive at the doors to the throne room
they open the doors and peer inside, its not lit
minogar lights a torch
- desribe throne room
sasha checks the back wall and sees the outline of a secret stone door
marlade sweats
marlade goes up to the door and tries to open it, it opens no problem
minogar leads the way with his torch into the dark
it leads to a dead end, but they find another secret door
they open the door and see a well furnished room.
- describe room
they hear a voice "who goes there"
minogar says its his love
sasha says they have found who has been taking the gnomes and they have proof
"proof, proof, you have proof, gnomes have been killed?"
"you found the monster did you"
the king starts to become a bit more lucid
sasha explains the mimic
"that explains everything, gnerkli it was a mimic!" he turns to another gnome who is tied to a chair with a sock in his mouth
the gnome says something through the sock, but its unintelligable
korboz goes over and releases gnerkli from the chair, gnerkli thanks the adventurers
marlade starts to take apart the barricade that the gnome had built on the door
sasha asks who is this person you have tied to the chair
he explains they are both king
he did it for his protection,
the group seem concerned about his methods
gnerkli gives the group a look as if to say help, but hes smiling on the outside
minogar kneels down to gnerkli and asks if he is ok
gnerkli offers the group a reward
mira says there is a cursed boy they need their help to save
the kings say their inventors should definitely be able to help them
mira says the inventors wont help until they have seen the king is ok
minogar pipes up and says they should also be rewarded with treasure
korboz says of course, if you would prefer treasure you can have that instead
the group decide that actually it would be best to save the boy
korboz smiles and says you can have both
gnerkli takes the group through to their treasure room
- describe room
the gnome pulls out an amulet and gives it mira
he pulls out a pole that can retract and expand on command, minogar takes it for now
the gnome laughs and says he will stop messing and give them real treasure, he pulls out a chest, the group gain a load of gold (250) which the group split
the group go with gnerkli back to the inventors, they see the king is well and he instructs them to help the group
the inventors ask what invention they needed again
sasha says they have a cursed boy, the inventors go ahah and turn around to their workstation. they produce a gizmo and hand it to mira (discombobulationator)
describe the contraption (with the press here)
minogar asks if the button can also be written in giant
the gnomes look confused for a second, but they ask what the word would be in giant, and engrave it on at minogars instruction
minogar looks delighted
the group decide now is the time to head back to phandalin, they head north from the inventors room
they enter a room with alcoves
- describe room with sleepy gnomes
the group attempt to sneak past, marlade shouts why are they being quiet and wakes up some of the gnomes
"whats all the shouting"
minogar says they are on the way out
"oh carry on then" the gnome says half awake probably still dreaming
the group exit the room and are now on a 30ft ledge above the shallow water outside
sasha decides to fly down with her new wings and takes mira with her
minogar lowers marlade down with some rope and climbs down himself no problem
the group walk back to phandalin, as they leave the magic of gnomengarde wears off and sasha wings fade away
