# Prelude

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.

A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.

Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.



## Session 1 - 03/03/2020
### Chapter 1
##### Arrows

In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked a band of adventurers to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found “something big,” and that he’d pay them ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen’s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of business.”

The heroes have spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and have just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. They’ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.

Kromnir realises at this point that the group have not actually introduced themselves to each other properly, and asks their names. The group consists of Kronmir Ragnulfson himself - a dwarven barbarian, Sung Jin-Woo - a human rogue, and Sacralis - a half elven monk.

All three currently hail from Neverwinter itself, Kronmir looking for revenge on the 'Shadowhand' clan that have taken everything from him, Sung wanting to earn a living after leaving the Neverwinter Guard due to "personal differences" and Sacralis, never really having a true place in the world and wanting to earn her own way after leaving a monastery.

Sacralis, being the most capable of the group with reins to a horse, has been driving the caravan since they left Neverwinter, with the other two in tow on foot. The group continue down the trail and notice two dead horses lieing in the road next to an overturned caravan, with dark black arrows sticking out of their corpses. Now that their path is blocked, the group stop and mull over how to proceed.

They exercise caution and begin to survey the surrounding area, the woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.

Sung decides to sneak around in the bushes to left of the caravan to see if he can flush out any would-be ambushers.

As luck would have it, he sees an unsuspecting goblin hiding behind a bush, giggling away to itself, facing the remaining two adventurers. Sung silently unsheathes his sword, the blades edge flashes briefly in the midday sun. Slowly, he approaches the creature, and raises his sword above his head, high.

As quick as he dares, he plunges the blade down into the neck of the goblin, through his collarbone and into it's windpipe. The goblin lets out a muffled cry before being silenced and Sung slowly lowers the goblin's corpse to the ground so as not to alert any other enemies.

Panic sets in and the other members of the group begin to search around the area for more, but find nothing. Kromnir believes he can hear tapping coming from somewhere...

Searching around, Kromnir goes up to the caravan.

An arrow flies through the air and nearly hits Kromnir dead in the face, but instead rattles on the caravan's arches, inches from his head. Three more goblins, one to the left of the trail near Sung, and two to the right, leap up and begin to attack.

However, the heroes are resilient and are not surprised; Sacralis rushes over the lone goblin and swings at it with her sword. But! The golbin's armor is too strong, and deflects the hit. Furiously, she punches at it with her free hand, but the goblin steps back and she misses.

Kromnir enters in a rage state and readies his greataxe, he lurches towards the goblins on the other side of the trail and slices one in half as if it wasn't even there.

The other goblin panics seeing Kromnir immense strength and begins to flee the scene. The now only remaining goblin retaliates against Sacralis, mortally wounding her with it's sword as it lets out a manic cackle.

Annoyed, Sacralis tries once again to hit the goblin with her sword, but it's armor again deflects the blade. She follows up with a swift left hook, clocking it's bottom jaw and causing it to bleed from the mouth. The goblin spits out a tooth and gives her a creepy smile.

Kromnir rushes over and launches a javelin at the now wounded goblin, the javelin's aim is true and comes down hard on the goblins cranium, piercing it through.

The goblin staggers for a second and looks up at the javelin, now protruding out from it's forehead, then falls down, dead.

Sung looks over to the fleeing goblin, he takes out one of his daggers and sizes up the shot. He flings his dagger upwards and it lands smack onto the goblins calf, the goblin brushes it off and continues to limp away, leaving a trail of blood in it's wake.

The group collects themselves, and inspects the damage to Sacralis, it is severe but decide she can make it to Phandalin, there they can seek to rest and recover.

### Chapter 2
##### Rope

Sacralis takes up the reins of the caravan once more, the group decide that having her walk might put too much pressure on her wounds.

Kromnir finds a rock on the ground that looks a little like a face and shows it Sung, who picks it up and throws it away, telling him to focus incase more goblins or bandits are waiting to ambush them.

As the caravan continues down the trail a trap is sprung!

caravan and Sung takes up the reins instead.

Growing tired as the evening begins to set in, the group turn the final corner towards Phandalin and see the town on the horizon.

Sung hasn't noticed that this is not the end of the traps, and drives straight over a covered pit, and so him and the caravan fall head first into the 10 foot deep pit.

The group ponder for a second as to how they are gonna get out of this mess, and Sacralis takes out her rope and throws it down to Sung.

Sung climbs out with relative ease and realises that the pit isn't as steep as initially thought. He takes his own rope and ties it to the caravan and using all his might, slowly pulls the caravan free of the pit, horses and all!

After this, the group continue around the pit, being extra vigilant to spot any more traps.

A few moments later, the group arrive at the gates of the mining town of Phandalin, cargo safely in tow and in just about one piece!
